Priota, however, earned her fame and popularity by her own merits.\nShe initially worked as an actor and a model. Priota presently works as a travel and video blogger, manages the online community 'The Flag Girl', and is the brand ambassador for Bangladesh Tourism Corporation.\n\n\n\n\"I love to empower women and I am proud to represent the Bangladeshi flag abroad,\" said Priota to The Business Standard. \"Whenever Bangladeshi girls want to travel, they are told to wait until they are married. But we too need to travel overseas for work and education.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriota was nominated for a leadership programme organised by the US embassy in 2009. Her mother was a single parent and many people urged her not to allow Priota to attend the programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The boys could easily go out without any problems. I could not simply because I was a girl. I didn't like this. So, I ran away from home.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThis, however, was not the first time she ran away. Priota desperately wanted to travel to Sri Lanka to attend a cricket match and watch the Bangladesh team play. But her family would not let her, so they confiscated her passport. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling like there was no other way, Priota stole a handbag and took with her a Bangladeshi flag. She headed straight to the airport. Although she was stopped, Priota was eventually allowed on the plane. She believes it was the national flag that allowed her to do this. She carried the Bangladeshi flag with her during her travels ever since.\n\n\n\n\"I have carried our flag with me to many countries and stages. I did it so other girls can find the courage to do the same.\"\nPriota studied at a private university in Dhaka. She also graduated from Anupam Kher Acting School in India.\n\"Since 2013, I have had a lot of freedom. I modelled for some commercials. But when I landed acting jobs, one of my colleagues made negative comments about my performance. I decided to study acting afterwards.\"\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriota lost her father at an early age, and her mother passed away in 2017. She still grieves her mother's passing. Priota was studying acting and filmmaking in Mumbai at the time, dreaming of establishing herself. After receiving the news of her mother's demise, she hastily returned to the country. Priota could not bear to stand in front of the camera again ever again.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The person for whom I wanted to fulfil my dream was gone. I was no longer interested in working in the media afterwards.\"\nPriota dreamt of travelling abroad by herself, but she also wanted to encourage and empower other Bangladeshi women to do the same.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has travelled to many countries by herself, and befriended people around the world. Priota always gives her friends a flag of Bangladesh, whether they are from Bangladesh or abroad, and asks to carry it with them when travelling overseas. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of her friends have fulfilled her wish. Whenever they visit a new country, they post pictures of themselves holding the flag.\n\"I want to show the Bangladeshi flag to the world. I ask my friends to carry the flag every time they travel abroad.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriota is the founder of the online community 'The Flag Girl'. She started this project in 2009, and it allows people to make friends from around the world.\nYoung people from more than 50 countries are members of this network.\nIn 2018, Priota became the winner of the Miss Culture Worldwide. The final event of the competition was held in December at Harare, Zimbabwe, organised by the National Branding and Investment Firm of Zimbabwe. Fifty countries participated in the pageant.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the event, Priota dressed up as a female freedom fighter to highlight the contribution of women during the Liberation War of Bangladesh.\nShe has also represented Bangladesh in various international pageants which includes Miss Tourism World and Miss Multinational.\nPriota received the 'Joy Bangla Youth Award' in 2018 for her contribution to women empowerment and social development.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriota dreams of the day when Bangladeshi girls will be able to travel freely around the world. She also dreams of the day when people from abroad will want to come to visit Bangladesh the same way she wanted to visit their countries.\n\"Many of my foreign friends come to visit me the same way I went to visit them. They stay at my house,\" she said. \"I think it is a cost-effective way to travel.

Our values give meaning to our existence and most times, our satisfaction and performance depend highly upon whether we are able to express our values at work.\n\n\n\n\nPeople rarely change, our priorities however are at the mercy of a multitude of externalities. A person who values travelling and adventure may do things like trekking or mountain climbing at a young age but as they grow older, the person may express those values by operating a global business that would involve travelling.\nSo, first identify your values, evaluate them, and then ask yourself if you are able to express those values through your work, therein lies fulfilment. You may even sit with your manager and find ways to pursue tasks that align best with your core values.\n\n\nAm I further developing my skills and knowledge?\n\n\nWe often find ourselves acquiring new skills, pieces of knowledge or traits through our work. Learning something new and building up your expertise in your sector is an achievement in itself.\nSo, find out what competencies you plan to improve this year and how you will make it happen. We can grow our knowledge base and skills by attending courses, workshops or conferences, experimenting with new ideas and even by reading a book. Reflect on the progress you made last year and take actions to support the growth you desire.\n\n\nAm I choosing the right path?\nYou may come across many opportunities that broaden your skill set via completely new and uncharted avenues. Even if the offers presented to you are lucrative, you should assess your opportunity cost - consistent career path or better benefits?\nBeing opportunistic, in such instances, will not do any harm but do not let it delineate you from your path, your true calling. You might have come across this question -\n\"Where do you see yourself in the next five years?\" - and if you already have a solid answer figured out, you can easily assess the opportunity cost.\nSimply put, if you do not know where your career path will lead you to in the next five years, take the time and try figuring out what it is that you want to achieve in your career or life.\nNo matter what you aim to be as a professional, having the course planned out and holding yourself accountable to said course, can take you to newer heights and achieve higher fulfilment.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/10/tiny_female_person_with_spyglass_looking_for_job_opportunities.jpg"}

If the vice-chancellors provide any recommendations, they will be added.\"\nThe policies have been prepared for all public science and technology universities, agricultural universities, medical universities and engineering universities.\n\n\nA majority of public university vice-chancellors allegedly engage in controversial recruitments at the end of their tenure, which include recruiting family members at the universities.\n\n\nMoreover, a good number of public university teachers allegedly do not spend their allottedtime in their departments but rather take classes at private universities or other institutions.\nHaving observed such irregularities, the ministry has taken the initiative to formulate the policies.\n\n\n\"With the new policies in place, we will be able to know how much manpower is needed for a university and we can easily check on unnecessary recruitment. Basically, we want to bring discipline to the universities so that our teachers can be dedicated to research and academic activities only,\" said Professor Dil Afroza.\nAccording to the policy, every department will have to evaluate teachers' performance and send the evaluation to the university authorities. Every university will be required to submit its performance reports to the UGC every six months.\nEmployees too will have to work 35 hours each week, which means each employee will have to work seven hours as direct working hours a day.\nThe UGC will then evaluate the performance of the teachers and employees and fix the amount of manpower required for each university. No additional manpower will be recruited without the UGC's permission.\nIn line with the policies, no department will be allowed to admit more than 60 students for an academic session. Besides, a maximum of 30 students will be allowed to take practical classes at the laboratory.\nRecruitmentirregularities\nPublic universities are plagued with temporary recruitments based on nepotism and political recommendations. Later, the universities forced the UGC to make those appointments permanent.\nUnder these circumstances, the UGC issued a directive that banned all ad-hoc recruitments from 2011. But no university followed the directive. As a result, many VCs were allegedly involved in recruitment irregularities and have faced the music for their controversial activities.\nThe ministry has planned to make policies to check rampant appointments and bring academic activities under discipline.\nVCs welcome the move\nProfessor Akhtaruzzaman, vice-chancellor of Dhaka University, told TBS that the Load Calculation policies are a good initiative of the UGC and he believes it will ensure transparency among teachers and employees.\nProfessor Dr Satya Prasad Majumder, vice-chancellor of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, told TBS that the policies were much needed to check the recruitment irregularities in the country's public universities.\n\"I think the policies will compel the teachers to concentrate more in research and other academic activities,\" he added.\nDirect teaching hours in other countries\nIn India, the number of teaching hours for an assistant professor is 16 hours weekly; associate professors and professors have 14 hours, including time spent on tutorials and practicals.\nIn Sri Lanka, the number of teaching hours for assistant professors, associates, and full time professors is 6 to 7 hours a week and they are compelled to work more than 2 hours if the authorities require them to do so.\nThe number of teaching hours for senior lecturers, lecturers, and lecturers is 9 hours a week and 10 hours a week for assistants. They are also compelled to work more than 3 and 4 hours respectively if the authorities think so.\nIn the USA, assistant professors on average teach 9 to 12 hours weekly or two classes per semester. They are expected to conduct research projects and publish research papers. The position can be seen as a training period during which one works to develop a case for tenure.\nAssociate professors spend fewer hours on undergraduate teaching (about 6 to 9 hours a week) and are likely to lead graduate classes and advise graduate students on their dissertation projects.\nFull professors usually teach 3 to 6 hours per week. They take an active role in the research projects and dissertations of doctoral candidates.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/26/depositphotos_49261277-stock-photo-business-woman-lecturing-at-conference.jpg"}

The vaccine king GlaxoSmithKline shut their pharmaceuticals plant in Chattogram in 2018 amid the emergence of world class cost-effective local competitors, such as Incepta in vaccines and dozens of other drugs.\nNow, beginning from over-the-counter drugs to anticancer ones, Bangladeshi generic brands are everywhere.\nMultinational Bata was the synonym of shoes to Bangladeshi consumers for decades and it had no competitor brand to contend with here.\nLocal venture Apex Footwear that began as a contract manufacturer of Japanese and Italian brands in 1990 kept thriving in exports and in the early 2010s, it eyed the local market seriously.\nApex did not take even a decade to overtake the century-old global brand Bata in the Bangladesh market.\nAnother century-old foreign brand Singer has lost its refrigerator and television empire to the local brand Walton over the last decade.\nAccording to a 2021 research report by UCB Asset Management, Walton now holds 72% of the refrigerator market, while Singer caters to only 12% of the market while Jamuna, Minister and many other local brands also have eaten into Singer's market.\nSinger was a top player in the television market too, and Walton is now widely ahead of all with a 27% market share, while Singer is in the number two position with an 11% market share.\nLocal brands are yet to overtake foreign brands in air conditioners, washing machines and diversified kitchen appliances categories but with their increasing market shares they might not take many years to replicate the refrigerator and television success as local players. Walton is now investing heavily in research and development and marketing with its eyes on a global market.\nBangladeshi kitchen appliances brand Miyako with 21% market share is only behind Samsung.\nWalton began as a low-cost market contender in the late 2000s. Its Chief of Business Operation Sohel Rana believes on top of the supportive government policies, manufacturing and marketing products in line with the need and ability of local consumers helped the company grow big and now chase its global dreams.\nIndian Hero and Chinese Phoenix were the bicycles Bangladeshis had been riding for decades but now world-class Bangladeshi exporters, such as Meghna and RFL's Duranta, are grabbing a big chunk of the local bicycle market and set to overtake foreign brands.\nOlympic began as a local confectionery brand in the 1990s, while the market was fairly divided among a bunch of local brands and imported foreign ones.\nIt has now emerged as the market leader by a large margin.\nBangkok-based frozen ready meal giant CP entered Bangladesh in the late 1990s and expanded its retail outlets across the market in the 2010s. But the strong local contender Kazi Farms Kitchen has apparently overtaken its market in recent years.\nIn their busy lives, Bangladeshi consumers made Radhuni and Pran their top brand choices for ready spice mixes.\nLocal brands ACI Salt and ACI Aerosol are the market leaders by far here.\nIn tea, local brand Ispahani is the top brand leaving foreign ones, such as Lipton and Tetley, behind in competition.\nWhere foreign brands still dominate\nAccording to a BBC Report citing Kantar Worldpanel market intelligence in 2018, top nine brands in the Bangladesh market were multinational ones, Tibet ball soap occupying the tenth spot and leading all the Bangladeshi brands in terms of brand strength and value.\nUnderstandably, Unilever's Sunsilk shampoo, Lux soaps and Rin detergent are the strongest three brands.\nLocal \"Halal soap\" Aromatic's sudden spark and demise, local mass market soaps Meril and Keya or premium soap Sandalina are not ignored at all by a large group of Bangladeshi consumers.\nIn tobacco, paints, hair care markets, foreign players, including British American Tobacco, Berger, and Marico are still leading the pack but local aspirants did not leave them unchallenged.\nForeign hygiene product brands - Dettol and Savlon - have long been ruling the market but local brands, such as Square's Sepnil, are chasing them.\nFBCCI Vice-President MA Razzak Khan said the post-independent business environment and facilitation helped local brands grow and the Made-in-Bangladesh nowadays is fuelling the trend.\nBangladeshi corporates now have the needed financing capacity and value proposition to offer and very importantly the brains to let a brand compete and ascend to the top.\nHe believes a large number of local brands will come up stronger at home and abroad in the coming years.\nIn many industries, including the apparel sector, the market is still not much concerned about brands, but the situation is changing rapidly and local players, such as Aarong, Yellow and Sara are investing for their fair share amid the absence of formal retail outlets of global lifestyle brands.\nThat might make Bangladesh's market a new battleground for retail brands someday.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/26/brands.png"}

This horrific incident took place on a city road amid huge traffic.\nThe driver and a passenger of the white-coloured microbus were brutally shot, especially the latter, who was shot 6-7 times while the driver was shot twice.\n\n\n\nThe shots, fired in rapid succession, shattered the left side glasses of the car before hitting Jahidul Islam Tipu.\n\n\n\nHe was shot in the throat, chest and abdomen, among other body parts.

He died after being shot several times in the head in front of Shoppers World in Gulshan. A CCTV camera in the shopping mall picked up the entire incident.\nWhile being accused in Milky murder case, Jahidul Islam Tipu, then Motijheel AL general secretary, was granted a four-week interim bail on 23 July 2014. However, when he surrendered before the metropolitan magistrate court on 20 August 2014 after the bail period the court sent him to jail for alleged involvement in the murder of Milky.\nLater on 23 September 2015, the CID submitted the supplementary charge-sheet before the court against 18 accused, excluding Tipu, and a few others. Trial of the much-talked-about Milky murder case has not been completed yet though nine years have passed since the sensational killing. Sources said the Milky murder trial has remained stuck due to non-appearance of prosecution witnesses.\nAsked if the recent killing is related to the Milky murder case, DMP's Motijheel Division Deputy Commissioner Abdul Ahad told the media that primary investigation implies a planned murder and that the killers have been following Tipu to accomplish the killing.\nTwo individuals carried out the killing while more are likely involved, he said.\n\"We have got the motorcycle's licence plate number and learnt that the deceased had received several threat calls four-five days back. We are analysing all the information and hopefully will solve the puzzle,\" he added.\n\"We would not come to the conclusion at this point that the killing was Milky murder revenge but we are analysing every equation,\" a police official said.\nFarzana Islam Doly, 40, wife of Tipu and a reserved-seat counsellor of Dhaka South City Corporation, told the media that her husband had been the Motijheel AL unit general secretary for last ten years.\nPointing out feuds within the ruling party, Doly said, \"If you go talk to local people, they will probably be able to tell you who might have killed my husband.\"\nLocal people, however, declined to talk over the matter.\nWhat's the fault of the college girl?\n\"To whom will I seek justice?

As a result, global opinion quickly turned in Bangladeshs favour", "description": "A prolific academic, Ahmed Kamal has taught history for many years, notably as a professor of Dhaka University's history department, of which he also was the Chairman.\nCurrently a Honourary Professor at the university, Professor Kamal did his PhD thesis on the Muslim League, studying the reasons and history of the leading political parties' spectacular decline in the Pakistan.\nHe turned the research into a 2009 book titled \"State Against the Nation: The Decline of the Muslim League in Pre-Independence Bangladesh\" (1947-54).\n\n\n\nThe Business Standard spoke to Prof Ahmed Kamal on the occasion of Bangladesh's Independence Day. Here's an excerpt of the interview.\nEvents leading up to 26 March  cancelling the National Assembly session and stalling handover of power  had already created the background for declaration for independence. Why did Pakistani decision makers launch the 25 March crackdown, essentially a massacre? What was the end goal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery few among them [West Pakistani rulers] believed that they could retain East Pakistan after the election. Awami League (AL) won almost all the seats here, exactly 160 out of 162. On the other hand, Bhutto's party held majority seats in West Pakistan. But they didn't have any representation in East Pakistan. The two parts of Pakistan appeared like two separate countries after the election.\nBhutto was very eager to take power. That's why he floated the idea of two premierships. This dual premiership proposal by Bhutto created the ground for the beginning of the split of Pakistan.\n\n\n\nBhutto and military leaders together went for the military solution. They thought that a military defeat of the Bangalees would solve their problem. But the military solution didn't work, because the majority of people began a resistance war. At the same time, India's help played a significant role. As an inevitable result, it led to the birth of Bangladesh.\n\n\n\nThe voting clearly happened along the racial line. This must have been known to the leadership on both sides. Did they have any concern, and if so, how did they address it?\nWhen Yahya Khan came to Dhaka after 1 March, it was their attempt at a solution and subsequently it failed.\n\n\n\nA lot of what they discussed at that time is still not available in public record. Yahya, Bhutto and Sheikh Mujib had meetings among them, and sometimes one to one between them. We don't have the full record of these discussions.\nObviously, discussions centred around how to keep Pakistan together. The simplest way out would have been to accept the Six-point demands. If the West Pakistani leaders had done that then there could have been autonomy for both wings.\nBut they [the West Pakistan side] feared that accepting the Six-point would simply lead to 'Ek dafa' (one-point demand, suggesting independence). That's when they decided to end the negotiation.\nThey were also mobilising the military at the same time. But the talks were futile. Sheikh Shaheb could not give up Six-point demands. People were for the Six-point. He could have lost his leadership if he compromised.\nThe declaration of independence came after the crackdown began on 25 March mid-night. It is conceivable that it could have come earlier. The condition was sufficient in many ways for a declaration of independence. But the declaration made after the launch of a military assault gave it clear diplomatic legitimacy. How important was this element in the liberation struggle in terms of international acceptance?\nThis made it a resistance struggle. We did not launch the war. We resisted. We became the owners of this land by resisting the Pakistan army.\nI think this was immensely important. He took a path that would be very acceptable internationally. As a result, global opinion quickly turned in Bangladesh's favour.\n \n\n\n\n\nSix-point demands, spearheaded by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,  is considered a milestone on the road to Bangladesh's independence. Photo: Wikimedia Commons\r\n\nOn the one hand, a genocidal attempt was launched and on the other, we had the legitimacy of our struggle. These two facts together gave us international support very quickly.\nEven without a specific declaration on 26 March, people would likely have taken the 7 March speech as the declaration of independence, especially after a military assault on the people. How significant is 26 March, considered in isolation?\nThe 26 March declaration (by Sheikh Mujib) of independence actually did not reach the general public immediately. But people began to resist. He told the people even if he could not be around to give orders people should resist on their own.\nEven without his instruction, people of the then East Pakistan, would have launched resistance struggles irrespective of their political positions. Not everyone heard his declaration of independence [broadcast on 26 March].\nBut people heard the declaration of independence by Zia. And the announcement by him gave people strength. It made people think that \"we have people in the army and they have revolted'. It didn't really matter how many there were, or how powerful they were.\nPersonally, I remember hearing Zia's announcement of the declaration and thinking that we had people on our side who could fight in the war. This was a strong morale boost. No one knew who Ziaur Rahman was. It could have been anyone else. He was not important as a person. But the fact that it was an announcement from a Bangalee in uniform made it so important.\nWhat was the point of the negotiation if it was predestined to fail?\nIt didn't have to fail. If they accepted the Six-point demands, or even a closer version, the negotiations could have worked.\nBut the military leadership did not accept it because of Bhutto's desire for power and the military's fear that it would lead to one-point demand. They had an assumption that if they went to a military solution then they could subdue the people in East Pakistan.\nWhat was the role of the leftist political parties in events leading up to the war and overall?\nThe leftist parties were the first to publicly state the intention of liberation for Bangladesh. Mawlana Bhasani articulated this demand as early as 1956 Kagmari Conference. Near the end of 1970, the Purba Bangla Communist Party's student leader Mahbubullah publicly called for Bangladesh's liberation war. He was arrested on this charge and was in jail from December 1970 throughout 1971. But they didn't have the wide public acceptability, so it did not start the independence struggle.\nWhy is there a problem with fake freedom fighters and why is there no reliable list of true freedom fighters?\nBecause the people, in charge of making the list, are fake freedom fighters, at least many of them. Making an authentic list and making a true list of martyrs was very easy. It would have been so easy to get data from the union councils across the country. If you took the names from every Union, it could have been done so easily.\nThe post-71 government gave one-time stipends of Tk2000- and Tk1000 for martyrs and wounded freedom fighters. The list which was made for distribution of this stipend was very close to the real number of freedom fighters.\nBut if you are in the ruling party, and you want to make everyone in your family a freedom fighter, that's a problem. Getting listed as a freedom fighter comes with a lot of facilities that are given by the government. You get a stipend, you get privileges in job recruitment and you get status. So, this is a coveted thing and it's only natural that people would want this. It could have been prevented, but no one stopped it.\nIndia was Bangladesh's biggest ally in the liberation war. Bangladesh recognises that, as it should. In 2022, how should Bangladesh think about its relationship with India?\nIf there is a friendship between you and me, and I want you to always do as I wish, then you will not want that friendship.\nThe hegemonic politics by India made most Bangladeshi people a little bit anti-India. The mistake that India made was that it could have built its friendship in an easier way.\nIndian media, its movies most notably, diminishes Bangladesh's role in the war. It has always portrayed the conflict as merely a war between India and Pakistan. Why do you think this is the case?\nBecause this is a natural thing for them to do. Any country will make its own part look more important. But there's another problem with highlighting Bangladesh's part in the fight for liberation.\nThere are separatist struggles that exist in many parts of India. But they do not have the power to go against such a big state. India will not do anything that legitimises these struggles. If India focuses on Bangladesh's struggle, then the Tamils or the\nSikhs or others would say 'You are bragging about supporting a liberation struggle, but here [you suppress our struggle for self-determination]. So, India will never do it.\nAs a historian how do you evaluate the history scholarship on the liberation war?\nNo historical account is a complete history. The perspective, political ideology, etc. influence a historian's writing of history.\nA historian has the training on how to write history. You can write history with a particular focus. It can be centred around the mass people, it can be centred around political leadership, and so on.\nHistory depends on the historian. There is no one thing called 'history'. If that was so, then you would have one book called 'Bangladesh's history', and that would be it.\nBut the historical writings and understandings should be continuously challenged and should evolve.\nFacts are unchangeable. The interpretations can change. But history will always depend on the historian writing the history and what he wants to focus on.\nThere is no history of the liberation war from the perspective of women. Similarly, there is no history from the perspective of workers and peasants. All histories are focused on political parties and the role of political leaders.\nIn the future you might see historical works on our liberation war that haven't been attempted so far.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/26/untitled.jpg"}

Bangladesh beat the hosts by 9 wickets in the series decider at Centurion on Wednesday thanks to Taskin Ahmed's brilliant five-for and Tamim Iqbal's captain's knock of unbeaten87.\nIt took Tigers only 26.3 overs to chase down a petty 155 runs set by the hosts. It was more fitting that Tamim and Shakib Al Hasan were at the crease as they sealed their historic series victory over the Proteas.\nAs history knocked on the door, the Bangladesh openers - Tamim Iqbal and Litton Das - batted fearlessly to chase a small target of 155 runs at what is regarded as a difficult ground to chase.\n\n\n\nThey also made the highest opening partnership (127) against South Africa in ODIs. This was also the third-highest opening stand for Bangladesh away from home.\nSkipper Tamim Iqbal brought up his 52nd career half-century in ODI in 52 balls. This was also his third half-century against the Proteas in this particular format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe eventually remained unbeatenon 87 from 82 balls, playing at a strike rate of more than 100. He struck 14 boundaries in his sublime innings.\nOn the other hand, the man in fine form Litton Das capitalised on the life when he was yet to open his account as Rassie Van der Dussen dropped a catch of him. Litton accompanied his skipper well before departing for 48 off 56 deliveries.\n\n\n\nThe openers started cautiously in the chase. They were going just above 4 runs an over until 10 overs. In the 11th over, Tamim cut loose to hit four boundaries off Rabada's over and there was no looking back from there.\n\n\n\nShakib came to bat at number three but he had very little to do. He remained unbeaten on 18 .\nEarlier, Taskin rattled South Africa's batting andbecame the first away bowler to bag the first five-for in South Africa since 2012.\n\n\n\nBut it wasn't Taskin who began the wicket fest for the Tigers.\nMehidy Hasan Miraz picked up the first wicket of de Kock who was caught at long-off by Mahmudullah Riyad in the seventh over, the hosts were 46 for 1and everything just changed from there.\nThe hosts managed to bag only 49 more runs in the next 14 overs, and lost half of their batting order.\nTaskin's first victim wasKyle Verreynne who was dismissedwith a rather poor delivery which Verreynne dragged in back to the stumps and the 20-run partnership was broken.\nAnd it was all Taskin after that. He ran in and banged the ball into the pitch and utilised the variable bounce on offer at the SuperSport Park to full effect.\nHe then went on to pick up the wickets ofJanneman Malan,David Miller,Dwaine Pretorius andKagiso Rabada.\nApart from his five-for, Shakib bagged a brace for 24 runs while Shoriful Islam and Miraz picked up a wicket each.\nFor South Africa, Malan top-scored with 39 and Mahraj bagged 28.\nTaskin, who finished with figures of 5-35, said he tried to stick with his basics and it worked out for him on the day.\n\"I stuck with my process and basics, and thankfully it worked out. I tried some variations but stuck to my line and length. I'm following my process for the last two years and that's why its working,\" he said.\nPresident Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina congratulated Bangladesh national cricket team for making a history by winning the first-ever ODI series against South Africa.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/23/dl.beatsnoop.com-1648038326_0.jpg"}
{"created_at": "25 March, 2022, 01:30 pm", "title": "You need political commitment, in the first place, for decentralisation of healthcare", "description": "Last Sunday, former health minister Dr AFM Ruhul Haque revealed the findings of a study on the Bangladesh health care system. Haque, in collaboration with the non-government organisation Eminence Associates for Social Development, conducted the study last year.\nThe study, titled \"Bangladesh health sector: present challenges and future guidelines\", identified various problems of medicare facilities.\nRashid-e-Mahbub, public health expert and chairman of the Bangladesh Health Rights Movement, reflected on the study's findings and discussed the overall conditions troubling our healthcare system in an interview with The Business Standard.\n\n\nThe study found that one of the biggest problems for Bangladesh is the centralisation of the healthcare system. In the rural and suburban areas, doctors, medicine and facilities are hardly available as opposed to the urban areas. What is your take on the study? How do you think this centralisation problem can be solved?\nYes, our healthcare system is highly centralised. And there are many problems associated with centralisation. But whatever you need to do, you need a political commitment in the first place. Political commitment means whether the government is willing or not.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIllustration: TBS\nFirst, the authority has to come up with essential policy decisions and consensus on whether they really want decentralisation. If they do, then the focus should be on how the process would take place and in what form. Only then a meaningful outcome will be visible.\nIf the government is not willing or lacks political will, we are helpless. Then the responsibility goes to political parties and professionals and civil society groups. They, in the interest of the people, demand change from the government.\n\n\nI think since the independence of Bangladesh, we have been talking about this. Even during the Ershad regime, there was a health policy related to decentralisation.\n\n\nUnder the current government, there were two health policies, and decentralisation is mentioned in both. So, the topic of decentralisation is not something new, however, it was never implemented.\nOne of the reasons for not starting the process is that our healthcare depends much on international donations. Donor dependency is a big issue. If the international community/donors do not insist on decentralising the healthcare system, the implementation will not be possible.\n\n\nThere is also a conflict of interests. The world is run by capitalist thought. A neoliberal economy suggests less government spending on education, healthcare etc. and that people should spend their own money [what we see happening in the United States].\nThe notion is that government welfare should be limited. So the government prescribes to the idea that treatment can be availed by spending money.\nThere are some similarities with our primary education. While it is free to study, the state of primary education is abysmal. And quality is not ensured. As a result, inequalities are rising.\nIn the same way, public medical facilities are inadequate. The \"out of pocket\" cost is much higher in comparison with other South Asian countries. And continues to get higher and higher.\nI do not understand the rationale of coming into a public platform and talking about these things. AFM Ruhul Haque is a member of parliament; he could have raised his voice in the parliament. A former minister, a chairman of a parliamentary committee, coming to a public platform  it doesn't mean much.\nWe do organise such studies and public releases, press briefings to draw government attention. But he is a part of the government. As a member of the parliament, he can lobby with the health ministry and the prime minister. Did he tell the PM that they were thinking about these points?\nThe study also found irregularities in the purchase of medical equipment and negligence in the maintenance of hospital equipment. Valuable resources are wasted, and we have also seen many allegations of mismanagement. Why do you think this is the case?\nThese stem from a lack of commitment. Many more things are needed along with decentralisation.\nThe authorities successfully pushed the public against the doctors. People are angry at doctors, and the two sides are in a face to face situation.\nThe blame is put on the doctors. That they do not want to go to villages or suburban areas. But the fact is there is little scope to work in the villages. They never tell us this fact.\nRather than solving the problem at hand, the focus is on the blame game. Moreover, the private sector's development is totally out of control. But even private healthcare is also centralised. You can only find good ones in the city areas.\nAllegations are prevalent. The root-level health sector lacks manpower. Many posts of the upazila hospitals remain vacant. Local arrangements can be done here. It is also true that often many expensive logistics are brought in but they [manpower or hospital officials at the upazila level hospitals] do not know how to use them. Maintenance is not proper.\nYou have to remember that doctors alone do not cure ailments. Logistics is very necessary. However good the doctors are, logistical deficits will impact the efficiency of the healthcare system.\nOur cadre service is huge. Only a few people are taking all the decisions. That's not going to solve the problem. Moreover, the procurement process is not good enough. Logistical decentralisation and supervision are needed. Sitting in Dhaka, they are interested in procurement because there is money.\nOur hospitals are all the same, except the very specialised hospitals. However, community healthcare, union hospitals, thana health centres, districts hospitals  these things are not defined. What services will be available in what kind of hospitals are not defined. Also, people remain unaware of what services are available in which hospitals.\nBudget allocation for healthcare is considerably low in comparison with our neighbouring countries. Bangladesh is far behind in this respect than the standard set by WHO. Why do you think the government fails to allocate an adequate portion?\nThe commitment to the health sector is a big reason. There is no clear directive from the government on how the sector should be run, especially the public sector. Only the rich, the affluent class can avail the benefits of the private sector benefits. Poor people do not go there. Only the upper class can take the benefit of the private sector. Poor people have little access to good care.\nIn the last FY 2021-22, the budget allocation for health was only 0.95% of GDP. The World Health Organisation sets the standard figure of at least 3-5% of GDP as a minimum requirement for a country to perform well.\nBangladesh's allocation is too low. Less priority is given to medicare. Although during the Covid-19 pandemic, more than Tk20,000 crore was allocated, this constitutes an exception. Because it is not routinely given.\nHowever, there are many \"in-between\" lines. For example, in the armed forces, the treatment and medical-related facilities are provided from the health budget. That does not come from the military budget.\nTo make it people-friendly, there need to be significant changes. The government's commitment to providing quality healthcare must be clarified and necessary measures should be implemented. Conflicts of interest need to be evaded.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/25/panorama_health_1_final_1.jpg"}
{"created_at": "26 March, 2022, 02:40 pm", "title": "The green land of Bangladesh painted red with blood", "description": "Some months back, while I was working on an article on the liberation war of Bangladesh, I encountered Motahar Hossein on social media. The 64-year-old Motahar Hossein was in class four on 25 March 1971. He was a student of Central Government School. His father was a railway clerk and they lived at the Shahjahanpur railway colony in Khilgaon.\nOn 25 March 1971, Motahar, with his siblings and parents, was hiding under a bed and a table. \"Back then\", Motahar told me, \"Rajarbagh police line had a bamboo-made hostel and that night the Pakistani army set it on fire. That fire was so massive that we could see the adjacent field turn absolutely white from the light of it.\"\n\n\nFor the next two days, they remained in the capital, preparing to migrate to their village in Dohar, eventually leaving on 28 March. But his father stayed behind in Dhaka as the Pakistani government had ordered the offices to be kept open.\nAs I was studying further for this article, many such stories came to my newsfeed. Amitav Basak Bappy remembered the moments on 25 March when the Pakistani military rampaged through the Basak lane in old Dhaka and burnt down the 'Sangbad' newspaper office; and how at 11:30 pm on that night, the Pakistani army got out from the cantonment and started the massacre from the Farmgate area. \n\n\n\n\nIt was then when I recalled the line by Major Rao Farman in his table diary: \"Green land of East Pakistan will be painted red.\" These stories prove that Bangladesh was indeed painted red with the blood of the Bangali people.\nRight after the birth of Pakistan, the two parts of the country found themselves differing on every front -- from cultural to economic and political. At the foreword of the book Genocide They Wrote by Inam Ahmed and Shakhawat Liton, the publisher Mahfuz Anam wrote, \"In March 1971, we were still a part of Pakistan. People of East Pakistan- Bangalis- were as much citizens of the country as the Punjabis, Balochis, Pathans and the Biharis with equal rights in every aspect. So how could \"our\" own army cool-heartedly plan a systematic killing of its own citizens?\"\n\n\n\"That's because\", writes Anam, \"we Bangalis were never equal citizens of Pakistan.\" And that's what we see in the photographs and documents of 25 March and from later -- how brutally the Bangalees were killed. As if it was the physical manifestation of what General Tikka Khan said: \"I want the land, not the people\". The Pakistani army worked accordingly.\n\n\nPrelude to 25 March\nFrom the very beginning, Bangladesh was going through an uprising starting from 1952 and stretching out intermittently to 1969, before eventually heading into the liberation war.\n\n\nOn the other side, West Pakistan was going through a leadership problem since the death of Jinnah. In March 1969, General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan staged a coup and seized power from President General Ayub Khan. It was right at the time when the mass upsurge of 1969 was going on in East Pakistan.\nIn Genocide They Wrote, the book mentioned above, the writers note, \"Like any other military dictator, Yahya Khan was quick to announce that he would return the country to democracy soon and accordingly held general election in December 1970.\"\nBut just like any other military dictator, it was never his intention to let go of the power. It's just that he couldn't fathom the popularity of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his political party. \"Whatever Jinnah knew about East Pakistan, his successors appeared to know even less,\" wrote Inam Ahmed and Shakhawat Liton.\nThe Awami League under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman won the 1970 election decisively, making the party eligible for forming government. But Yahya started his evil games and postponed the national assembly on 1 March for an indefinite period.\nAt this point, we have to mention Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the villain extraordinaire. \"It was he who had advised the military rulers not to hand over the power to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. It was he who had staged a game of dialogue with Mujib on power-sharing just to buy time for the military to get into action. It was he who 'slept' blissfully throughout the March 25 night while Dhaka burned,\" wrote Ahmed and Liton.\nBhutto left Dhaka the next day. He put much effort into making the diplomatic case for the war. Even at the last stage of the war in December, Bhutto had been to the United Nations Security Council and demanded a ceasefire and withdrawal of the Indian troops. It was the Soviet Union, who denied this and vetoed it three times.\nIf Bhutto was successful at the Security Council, history would have been very different for us, the people of Bangladesh.\nThe planning of the 25 March massacre\nIt was Major General Rao Farman Ali who designed and executed Operation Searchlight -- the crackdown on the sleeping people of Dhaka from March 25 night onwards. And Major General Khadim Hussain Raja was the man who wrote the detailed plan of Operation Searchlight.\nRao Farman himself prepared the five-page operation plan. It was decided that at the 13:00 hours of 25 March General Rao Farman Ali will give the lead in the Dhaka operation and General Khadim Raja will give the lead to operations in other regions of the province. Over the course of the next nine months, he made sure that his soldiers painted the green lands of Bangladesh red with the blood of Bangalees.\nAnd the planning was impeccable and brutal, for which Raja was later rewarded. In 1972, he became the managing director of the Army Welfare Trust of Pakistan, later still, he became the ambassador of Pakistan in Mozambique.\nIn 1971, East Pakistan had around 12,000 troops in the East Pakistan Rifles (EPR), most of whom were Bangalee soldiers. The Pakistani military, already preparing for the genocide secretly was bringing soldiers from West Pakistan in white clothes every night, to avoid alerting the Bangalee soldiers. The Bengali brigade major was kept out of this arrangement for reasons of security, as Siddik Salik, the public relations officer of the Pakistani Army wrote in his book Witness to surrender.\nWhile the Pakistani soldiers were carrying their light weapons, a separate ship brought more weapons and ammunition. Inam Ahmed and Shakhawat Liton mention in their book that seven thousand tons of ammunition were brought in on the ship MV Swat to the Chattogram port.\nThis makes it very clear that they were not here to quell any political unrest, they were here with a preparation of a full-fledged war, a war against the sleeping civilians. They were prepared for a cool-hearted genocide.\nThat night at about 11 pm, the green telephone of general Khadim Hussain rang. It was General Tikka Khan on the other side and he said, \"Khadim, it is tonight.\"\nAnd with that phone call, the annihilation began. Not just in Dhaka, but on the next day the Comilla Cantonment massacre was carried out by the Pakistan Army. Lt Colonel Mansoorul Huq claimed that 17 Bangalee army officers and 953 soldiers were executed in Comilla Cantonment on the night of 2728 March.\nBut this was apparently a \"patriotic task\" for the Pakistanis. In the book How Pakistan got divided Rao Farman Ali wrote, \"The ensuing operation was not the same as the other usual army operation. A usual army operation is carried out in aid to the civil government. But there was a need to use the force to restore the government's authority. It was necessary to suppress a mutiny.\"\nThis is the voice of a master talking about his slave. A master that wanted only to dominate us.\nBut that didn't happen. Although Lt General Niazi planted a strong defence strategy with a target of not yielding any ground to the Bangladeshi Mukti Fouj, in the end, the Pakistani military had to yield.\nBut today I, as a citizen of a free country and writing about the liberation war, cannot fathom the difficulties people went through. How little Motahar Hossain felt when he saw the bright white fire burning at Rajarbagh? Or how Amitav feels when he talks about his uncle who was slaughtered by the military?\nAll the bloodstains have been removed, and we have green fields filled with crops again. We sure have some new difficulties -- the price hikes, inflation, unemployment caused by the pandemic, traffic and air pollution, and so on. But all these are now 'our' problems that 'we' can fight and improve. We no longer have to bow down to some ruler living 1200 miles away from us. Now, after 50 years of independence that we earned, this alone feels like an achievement to me.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/26/272698203_648003546415650_1188170054731168266_n.jpg"}

In the first two months of this year, it overtook Russia as the country sending the most oil there.\nAmid geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and as the world lines up on either side of the conflict, the news has sparked fears that Saudi Arabia could end up on Russia's side.\n\n\nAllowing oil payments in yuan could help create a parallel system for international payments where the Chinese yuan becomes as important as the US dollar. This, in turn, would help Russia bypass sanctions, as the invading nation might then also use yuan. Publicly, China has remained neutral in the conflict, but is widely suspected of being quietly supportive of Russia.\nWill the Saudis really allow yuan payments?\nThe announcement by the Saudi leadership has mostly been seen as a way of putting pressure on their Western allies, experts said.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, as the European Council of Foreign Relations, or ECFR, wrote in a 2019 policy brief called China's Great Game in the Middle East, the Saudis have done this before.\nChina is often used as a \"bargaining chip,\" the ECFR analysts pointed out.\n\n\n\"For instance,\" they wrote, \"only a few months after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeared to use his tour of Asia to affect debates in the US and European countries on arms sales to his country.\"\n\n\nWhat about pressure on Saudi Arabia?\nThere have been attempts by the US and Europe to shore up Saudi support. American security adviser Brett McGurk travelled to the Gulf state last week, as did UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n\nUp until now, though, US and European officials have tried and failed to get Saudi Arabia to pump more oil , in an effort to alleviate oil prices. Along with the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia is one of the only oil producing countries with spare capacity. If more oil was on the global market, this might help relieve oil prices, which have risen to record-breaking highs thanks to disruptions in oil supply from Russia.\nIt was not reported as to whether the recent talks with Saudi officials involved oil payments in yuan.\nBut, \"even if Western diplomacy did succeed in bringing these countries on board, their [Saudi officials] worry is that the Middle East is destined to become less  not more  important,\" Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, told DW, referring to the US pivot toward the Asia-Pacific region and away from fossil fuel.\n\"They [the Gulf states] believe Washington has less to offer and less to threaten than it once did,\" Bianco, an expert on the Gulf region, explained further in a briefing published last week.\n\"Gulf monarchies' refusal to side with the US and Europe against Russia is not about Russia. It is about navigating the new multipolar world order, taking a transactional approach to protecting national interests,\" she wrote.\nHow is China involved?\nThis is where China comes into it. Ties between Saudi Arabia and China have been deepening for several years already. In 2020, Saudi Arabia was China's largest trading partner in the region, with imports and exports worth over $67 billion (60.6 billion).\nMostly, these ties have been based on a mutually beneficial economic relationship, one that highlights synergies between China's trillion-dollar, trade-boosting Belt and Road Initiative and Saudi Arabia's own modernisation project, Vision 2030.\nThere are obvious advantages to dealing with a country that will be a long-term buyer of gas and oil, while European customers are increasingly looking into solar and wind power.\nPart of Vision 2030 is about preparing Saudi Arabia for a future when oil is less important, and one aspect is to boost Saudi Arabia's potential as a logistics hub in the Middle East. The Belt and Road Initiative fits into this, and China and Saudi Arabia have what is known as a \"comprehensive strategic partnership\"  although experts like Bianco caution against calling the two nations \"allies.\"\nSome analysts have recently suggested that a new era is beginning in Chinese-Middle East relations.\nIn January, Roie Yellinek, a non-resident scholar at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, observed that a number of foreign ministers from the region had travelled to China that month.\n\"The fact that it was foreign ministers travelling to China, rather than their counterparts with the ministries of trade or economy, suggests a shift in focus,\" Yellinek argued in an article on the institute's website. \"After years of economic-oriented ties  recent events have made it clear that a new era has begun with a greater focus on geopolitics.\"\nThis includes a growing military component to the China-Saudi relationship. Between 2016 and 2020, Chinese arms transfers to Saudi Arabia increased 386%, according to the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in a February research paper.\nFirst China sold ballistic missiles to the Saudis, then it began to assist them with their production inside Saudi Arabia.\nAlso worth noting: The Chinese will deal with leaders the Americans won't. As analysts at the ECFR explained in their 2019 policy briefing, \"the Chinese model of authoritarian capitalism already fascinates many Middle Eastern regimes, which see cooperation with China as a means to resist Western pressure to pursue governance reforms and human rights accountability.\"\nIs this the end for the US dollar?\nThe Saudis first suggested the Chinese pay for their oil in yuan about four years ago. But even if this happens, there is unlikely to be any impact on foreign exchange markets in the short, and even medium, term, economic experts have said. Most oil is priced in dollars and it would be a long, complicated process to disengage from that.\nAnalysts have also pointed out that even if all Saudi and Chinese trade was paid for in yuan, this would only equal around $320 million (289 million) per working day. Meanwhile all trade in US dollars around the world is equal to roughly $6.6 trillion (6 trillion) every working day.\nIn the long term, though, there are fears that a parallel global system of foreign currency exchange could eventually emerge, using China's yuan as an alternative currency. India is reportedly also considering using the yuan for oil purchases from Russia, to avoid international sanctions.\nThis is seen by some analysts as a way for China to guard against a day when it might potentially become a victim of Western sanctions, the way Russia is being sanctioned now.\n\nAuthor Cathrin Schaer is a journalist based in Berlin.\n\nDisclaimer: This article first appeared on Deutsche Welle and is published by special syndication arrangement.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/23/chinese_president_xi_jinping_right_could_soon_be_making_a_trip_to_saudi_arabia.jpg"}
{"created_at": "25 March, 2022, 06:10 pm", "title": "Will sanctioning Russia fuel financial contagion?", "description": "The unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia  which some have dubbed economic weapons of mass destruction  have globalised the Ukraine crisis, exacerbating market uncertainty and potentially derailing the post-pandemic recovery. Across Europe and elsewhere, growth forecasts for 2022 have been revised down sharply.\nBeyond dampening output and causing already high inflation to spike further, these sanctions are heightening the risk of a financial crisis. Today's increasingly complex global financial system amplifies this danger, because the magnitude of derivatives markets and the co-dependency of supply chains and payment chains make contagion more likely.\nStagflation was already a looming global threat, and the war in Ukraine has further increased the danger. The world, still grappling with the fallout from the US-China trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic, now faces its third policy-induced economic crisis in quick succession.\n\n\nThe pandemic-related downturn, which disrupted supply chains and exacerbated inflationary pressures, was a crisis of necessity, because containment measures were the price paid to stem the spread of Covid-19 as best we could. But the impending growth slowdown and potential stagflation triggered by sanctioning Russia would  like the Sino-American trade war  be a policy-induced economic crisis of choice.\nOne lesson from the US-China trade war is that increased interdependence in the era of globalisation makes it extremely difficult to implement targeted economic sanctions  from trade barriers and tariffs to restrictions on financial transactions  without causing unintended consequences for countries not directly involved in the dispute. Two such effects are especially relevant to the Russia-Ukraine conflict: indirect \"collateral damage\" affecting third-party countries, and \"boomerang\" effects on the states imposing the penalties.\n\n\n\n\nCollateral damage usually results from trade destruction or diversion and increasing disruptions to just-in-time global supply chains. For example, the International Monetary Fund estimates that supply-chain problems triggered by the US-China tariff war and exacerbated by the pandemic slashed world output by half a percentage point and raised inflation by around a full percentage point in 2021.\nThe larger the economies imposing sanctions are, the greater the collateral damage is likely to be. Low- and middle-income countries, which depend heavily on trade for growth, invariably suffer the most, because they lack the economic infrastructure or capacity to capitalise on the distortionary effects of sanctions or on the opportunities arising from the short-term reordering of supply chains. Most entered the pandemic with limited fiscal space, reflecting the sharp reduction of global demand caused by the US-China trade war.\n\n\nIn some ways, the imposition of sanctions on Russia is affecting poorer countries more severely than either the trade war or Covid-19 containment measures did. In particular, sharply reduced access to essential products is raising the spectre of a global food crisis and pushing the prices of most commodities, including oil, to their highest levels in a decade  thereby also raising long-term inflation expectations.\n\n\nWhile higher commodity prices may herald a fiscal bonanza for oil exporters, they create serious macroeconomic management challenges for low- and middle-income countries in particular. Most are net importers of oil and must also contend with the growing risks of social unrest from rising food insecurity and, in some cases, hyperinflation.\nThe boomerang effects of economic sanctions can be just as significant. Again, an evaluation of the US-China trade war is instructive. In addition to the steep decline in US exports to China (and a similar decline in US imports from China), research by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Columbia University found that US firms lost at least $1.7 trillion in stock value because of the imposition of US tariffs on Chinese imports. US households also were affected as prices and exchange rates did not adjust automatically to shield consumers.\n\n\nFor China, the boomerang effects of the trade conflict accelerated the economy's slowdown, raising the possibility of a hard landing. Chinese officials are targeting GDP growth of about 5.5% this year  the slowest pace in decades, with the exception of the pandemic-related deceleration in 2020. This could have significant negative spillover effects for the rest of the world, and especially for developing countries, most of which count China as their largest trading partner.\nIn the Ukraine crisis, European economies that depend heavily on Russian energy have sought to mitigate the boomerang effects of sanctions by not extending the measures to Russia's hydrocarbon exports or Russian banks involved in the energy trade. But several European firms in other key industries with direct exposure to Russia will be significantly affected. In the transport and logistics sectors, several financially sound companies could face bankruptcy if the stringent and wide-ranging sanctions remain in place for a prolonged period.\nEven in the short term, the sanctions against Russia have caused substantial collateral damage, with mounting price pressures increasing many economies' internal and external vulnerability. Concurrently, and ironically, the commodity-market rally that the sanctions have fuelled is sustaining the flow of cash to Russia from Europe to cover the continent's essential energy imports.\nA new bout of supply-chain disruption is already stirring inflationary pressures, further weakening the post-pandemic recovery and raising the risk of stagflation in Europe. Simultaneously, sanctioning Russia threatens to worsen the debt crisis and could set the stage for a longer-lasting financial crisis. The risk of contagion will be exacerbated greatly if credit default swaps are not settled seamlessly in the event of Russian bond defaults, or if the sanctions herald a large-scale reallocation of public assets to hedge against the globalisation of political risks.\nThe ongoing struggle for geopolitical supremacy means that powerful states will increasingly be tempted to use economic sanctions to advance their strategic goals. In an economically and financially interdependent world, such measures will make policy-induced economic crises more frequent, and all countries will suffer the consequences.\nOne of the main challenges facing the world in the coming decade will be to ensure that no country's geopolitical interests supersede the quest for global prosperity. Unless we succeed, the risks of globalisation may come to outweigh the benefits. Diplomacy, undoubtedly, remains a better alternative to economic weapons of mass destruction.\nDisclaimer:This article first appeared on Project Syndicate, and is published by special syndication arrangement.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/25/petrol-africa-bloomberg.jpg"}

{"created_at": "25 March, 2022, 12:40 pm", "title": "How chronic oil pollution at sea goes unpunished", "description": "Nothing he had learned at his naval college had prepared the young marine engineer for what he encountered at sea: not for the toxic culture in which superiors bullied and abused junior crew members with seeming impunity, nor for the indifference with which seafarers treated the very oceans that earned them a living  illegally dumping contaminants into the waters without a second thought.\n\nThe engineer told DW that at first he was worried, sad even, as he witnessed how oily wastewater was routinely illegally dumped into the ocean from the giant tanker he worked on. But, as the pollution continued, he soon grew numb to it. \"Now, I've just accepted it  I know it sounds sad, but ...\" he trailed off.\n\nSatellite imagery and whistleblowers\nDumping oily wastewater into the ocean has been outlawed globally for decades, but an investigation by DW, in collaboration with the European nonprofit newsroom Lighthouse Reports and eight other European press outlets, has found that the practice is still common today, with potentially devastating effects for the environment.\n\nDuring the months-long investigation, DW and its reporting partners talked to several whistleblowers and experts, who described a cat-and-mouse game in which seafarers use different techniques to bypass pollution safeguards and try to avoid detection by the monitoring technology employed by some governments.\n\nSatellite imagery and data provided by the environmental group SkyTruth helped identify hundreds of potential dumps across the globe in 2021 alone. But the number of spills is most likely significantly higher because the satellites used by SkyTruth cover less than one-fifth of the world's oceans. According to the group's estimate, the amount of oily water dumped into the oceans this way could amount to more than 200,000 cubic metres (52.8 million gallons) annually, or roughly five times the equivalent of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska  one of the worst maritime environmental disasters.\n\nSeveral tons of oily bilge-water per ship\nGlobal trade is fueled by tens of thousands of merchant ships that are at sea every day, transporting everything from oil and luxury cars to smartphones and boxes of cereal. The tankers that transport our goods can measure close to 400 metres (1,300 feet) in length, with engines bigger than coach buses. As the ships make their journeys, liquids from the engine room, oil, detergents, water and other substances collect in the bottom of the vessel, the bilge. This noxious mixture, called \"bilgewater,\" is then stored in tanks. In a day, a single merchant ship can produce several tons of it.\nInternational regulations require that large vessels treat the bilgewater with an \"oily water separator\" before it is discharged into the ocean.\n\n\nEach litre of bilgewater pumped into the sea after treatment is permitted a maximum residual-oil proportion of 15 parts per million, or 15 milligrams of oil per litre of water (0.0005 ounces per quart), according to a limit set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 1973. The remaining toxic mixture is stored in tanks onboard and later discharged at harbour in port reception facilities.\nAll big vessels are required to have working separators. But many ships circumvent the system entirely.\n\n'It's very easy' when you use a portable pump\n\n\n\n\nDW and its partners spoke to five whistleblowers with years of experience working on container and chemical cargo vessels who say they have witnessed illegal bilge dumps. All of them requested anonymity out of fear of losing their jobs or being blacklisted for future opportunities.\n\nWhistleblowers such as the people interviewed by DW and its partners are often the only source of information for what happens when a ship is on the water. Though DW was not able to fully verify their accounts, the sources independently corroborated each other in key aspects and provided footage of the incidents they witnessed, as well as other documentation.\n\nAlmost all of the whistleblowers detailed a similar method for bypassing the oily water separator: a small, portable pump. \"It's very easy,\" one man who had witnessed it in operation on several occasions told DW. \"You can assemble this portable pump in five minutes and then detach (in) five minutes and hide (it) if someone is coming.\"\n\nThe pump is used to transfer the oily water into a different tank  in most cases, the sewage tank. On the high seas, ships are allowed to dump their sewage untreated. Then, the toxic mix is quietly released into the ocean, often under the cover of night or during inclement weather, when there is a lower chance of getting caught, according to several seafarers DW talked to. At night it is harder for authorities to verify the crime, and bad weather can prevent the deployment of surveillance ships and planes.\n\"If you were to do this in the English Channel in broad daylight in perfect weather, for example, you'd immediately have the water police on your tail,\" said Christian Bussau, a marine biologist with Greenpeace, who has been working on oil pollution in the North and Baltic Seas for over 25 years. \"But, if ships do it in bad weather, during storms or at night, they have a good chance of getting away unnoticed,\" he said.\n\nThe toxic effects of bilge pollution\n\n\nMaritime transport has more than quadrupled in the nearly five decades since the IMO arrived at its standard of 15 parts per million for oily-water discharges. Even bilgewater that has been treated to adhere to this legal limit has been found to be toxic to marine organisms, according to research published in 2021 by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute and co-authored by the ecotoxicologist Kerstin Magnusson. She said the current regulation should be reassessed. As global shipping continues to grow, bilge pollution is accumulating.\n\nOil pollution is a more acute problem than microplastics because it has immediate and direct toxic effects, Magnusson said. The impact of small oil discharges on marine life remains under-investigated, she added, but academic research suggests that even small oil spills can have lasting harmful effects on marine life when they happen frequently. And repeated spills create a form of chronic pollution that can have severe effects on the environment.\n\nAside from oil, bilgewater can contain a variety of hazardous substances, including various chemicals, detergents, inorganic salts, and metals such as arsenic, lead and mercury. The substances contained in the bilgewater can damage the microorganisms on which larger animals feed, and enter the human food chain via shellfish and fish.\n\n\n\nEU efforts against bilge dumping\nBecause the illegal dumps happen at sea, it is difficult for authorities and researchers to track them. That is why satellite imagery is used to monitor the seas for pollution. When a vessel discharges oily wastewater illegally, it usually creates a spill kilometres long and with a very distinct shape.\n\nA system set up in 2007 by the European Maritime Safety Agency, or EMSA, uses radar satellites to \"see\" through cloud cover and at night to identify possible spills. It alerts the respective member states when one is found. In some cases, substances such as algae can be mistaken for spills, which is why experts review the imagery. By cross-referencing the location of the spills with ship-location data, EMSA can sometimes identify the possible polluter immediately.\n\nSince its inception, the mechanism, called CleanSeaNet, has detected tens of thousands of possible oil slicks, and statistics show a reduction of illegal dumps in EU waters. But the system has its flaws.\nIllegal dumps \"still regularly occur in European waters,\" according to EMSA, and the number of spills detected and prosecuted remains low. Individual member states do not always follow up on the alerts, and, when they do, it is often not quickly enough.\n\n\nThe longer it takes authorities to verify a spill in situ, the less likely they are to find oil, as spills begin to dissipate. In 2019, only 1.5% of spills were verified within a critical three-hour time frame. Polluters are only caught in a fraction of cases.\nThe satellites are also not able to monitor EU waters continuously, meaning that there is a window of several hours each day during which oil spills can go unnoticed. To get a sense of the total scope of this issue in EU waters, SkyTruth combined data and assumptions from EMSA with calculations of satellite coverage.\nBased on that fairly conservative estimate, the group expects that every year nearly 3,000 slicks are caused by vessels discharging mineral oil into EU waters. That averages out to more than eight per day  the majority of which go unseen by satellites.\n\nThousands of undetected illegal dumps\nEMSA does not make its detailed detections public. But, using the same publicly available satellite imagery that the agency uses, vessel-tracking data and machine learning provided by SkyTruth, DW and its partners were able to identify more than 1,500 potential illegal dumps globally from July 2020 through December 2021. For about 180, it was possible to identify the vessel based on tracking data. These cases include repeat offenders and bilge dumping in protected areas.\n\nDW is not publishing the vessels' names, as the findings couldn't be independently corroborated with visual evidence. The preliminary data by SkyTruth identifies slicks from moving vessels with a high confidence. But the imagery cannot distinguish between mineral oil slicks and those caused by vegetable or fish oil.\n\nOf course, EMSA only monitors the coastal waters of member states. The majority of the world's oceans are not covered by satellites.\n\nSaving time and money with illegal dumps\nBecause it is so difficult to enforce the law, incentives to dump remain high. Illegally dumping oily wastewater can save a ship significant money. Annual compliance costs can reach over $200,000 (181,500) depending on the type and age of the vessel and what state it is in. Maintenance of onboard waste-processing machinery such as the oily water separator and disposal fees at ports can be costly, although some countries have started offering free disposal up to a certain amount.\nIn one case, described by a whistleblower, a leak in the vessel meant that there was too much bilgewater for the oily water separator to process. Finding the leak would have been a time-consuming \"headache,\" which could have reflected badly on the chief engineer.\n\nOften, only a small group of people are privy to the illegal activities: the crew members working in the engine room. Ships are hierarchical, close-knit organisations. Crew members are expected to follow orders and toe the line, no questions asked.\n\nWhen he joined the vessel, one man told DW, the chief engineer took him aside and told him about the dumping. \"He said: 'Be quiet, do not speak out  if you speak then it is very much trouble for you,\" the man said.\nAfter witnessing several dumps, he confronted the chief engineer, suggesting that the pollution might be illegal. \"I said: 'This is wrong,'\" the man said. \"And he terminated me.\" The man was lucky: He managed to find a different vessel. Others who dare to speak out are blacklisted.\n\nAs the chances of getting caught and the fines imposed in some countries are low, rule breakers can gain a significant advantage over their compliant competitors in this tight-margin business.\n\n\"The likelihood of the polluters' being fined a large amount is minimal,\" said Bussau, the Greenpeace marine biologist. \"There is still a certain incentive, for cost reasons, to illegally dump oil at sea,\" he said.\n\nReward program for whistleblowers\n\nOne exception to this is the United States, where a whistleblower reward program has helped prosecute dozens of cases, with fines going into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Penalties in Europe differ greatly depending on the country but are usually significantly lower. In Germany, for example, fines can often be as low as 15,000 ($16,600).\n\nAlthough the ultimate responsibility for what happens aboard lies with the captain and the ship's operating company, whistleblowers said the dumps often happened without the captain's knowledge. Captains are required to sign the ship's oil record book, a log in which the chief engineer is obliged to record transfers and discharges, but \"it's very difficult for [the captain] to assess what is written there or to even understand what is going on in [it],\" one of the whistleblowers said.\n\nThe oil books are also easy to falsify, according to the whistleblowers and experts, and not always thoroughly reviewed. Even when authorities check the records, Bussau said, \"only a fraction of these crimes are detected.\"\n\n\"We unfortunately have many black sheep on the high seas,\" he said.\n\n\nMax Bernhard, Naomi Conrad, Julia Bayer and Nina Werkhuser are investigative journalists. For the past months, together with Lighthouse reports and a group of other journalists, they have been investigating a little-known form of ocean pollution caused by global shipping.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and views of The Business Standard.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/25/oil_pollution.jpg"}

The government this week finally abandoned its reluctance to seek help from theInternational Monetary Fundand President Gotabaya Rajapaksa pledged tofulfillSri Lanka's obligations.\n\n\n\n\"Seeking help from the IMF is the most feasible way to get out of the crisis,\" said Ankur Shukla, a Mumbai-based economist with Bloomberg Economics. \"The Russia-Ukraine war hasworsenedthe already weak external balances situation, increasing the gap between external financial requirements and financing sources available.\"\nOne of Europe's worst conflicts since World War II couldn't have come at a worse time for Sri Lanka, which is still recovering from a brutal 30-year ethnic strife that ended in 2009. The South Asian country has sought to revive growth since, spending millions on tourism infrastructure, until the pandemic dealt a blow to its plans. The crisis also shows how Russia's war is putting some of the fragile developing economies at risk and imperiling decades of efforts to lift millions out of poverty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn South Asia, other vulnerable countries include Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal and Pakistan, Shukla said. Though direct trade and financial linkages with Russia and Ukraine are limited, the \"price and supply shocks are powerful,\" he wrote in anoteon March 9.\nWith a population of about 22 million, Sri Lanka is a net importer of goods from medicines to fuel. In December, petroleum products accounted for about 20% of inbound shipments and the costjumped88% from a year earlier. The increase in oil prices this year is adding to the burden.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe country has also been paying off external debt it piled on to help rebuild an economy scarred by the bloody civil war between the majority Buddhist Sinhalese and a Tamil minority that's predominantly Hindu. That has been draining its forex reserves.\n\n\n\nAnother pain point is tourism revenue. About 30% of visitors this year were from Russia, Ukraine, Poland and Belarus, and the war is threatening to turn off that tap. Sri Lanka earned $3.6 billion from tourism in 2019 before the pandemic slashed that to less than a fifth two years later, official data show.\nThe central government's foreign-owned debt stood at $32 billion as of November. Optimism that the government will soon manage to reach a deal with the IMF has already spurred a rally in the country's dollar bonds. An offshore bond due 2030 rallied to 49 cents to the dollar from a record low of 38.9 cents on March 9, while one-year default probability has dropped to 18.2% from as much as 31.3% in late December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nThe nation's international bonds need to be restructured by July as Sri Lanka doesn't have the necessary resources to pay the $1 billion due that month, Citigroup Inc. said in a Februarynote.\n \n\n\n\n\nResidents wait to buy liquefied petroleum gas, in Colombo on March 14.Photographer: Ishara S. Kodikara/AFP/Getty Images/Bloomberg\nBesides raising borrowing costs and devaluing the rupee,Central Bank of Sri LankaGovernor Ajith Nivard Cabraal also urged restrictions on non-essential imports of around 300 items from electronic appliances to apples and increases infuel pricesand power tariffs. \n\"The government seems to be reacting positively and that would help steer the economy to calmer waters in this time of unprecedented global challenges,\" Cabraal said by phone last week.\nYet for ordinary Sri Lankans, the pain is real. Civic groups have held vigils highlighting rising costs, while the main opposition party organized a mass rally in the capital city of Colombo on March 15, demanding the resignation of President Rajapaksa. The protests pose no immediate threat to his government, which commands almost two-thirds majority in parliament.\nSugath Chaminda, 44, said he spent about 10 hours to refuel his auto rickshaw, after being turned away by numerous gas pumps that had run dry. He then spent more time hunting for a cylinder of cooking gas, which was also in short supply.\n\"I don't know what the government is doing to have brought us to this situation,\" he said in Colombo.\n \n\n\n\n\nDrivers wait to refuel their auto rickshaws in Colombo on March 11.Photographer: Ishara S. Kodikara/AFP/Getty Images/Bloomberg\nSome of the inflation surge is also self-inflicted. Last year, the government banned imports of chemical fertilizers in an ambitious plan to promote organic farming. That caused a shortage of nutrients, leading to crop failure andprotests, prompting the government to reverse the decision in November.\nSri Lanka has also approached China and India for bilateral credit lines to avoid an IMF bailout, but negotiations have been complicated by the war in Ukraine. In the past, policymakers have generally considered some of the IMF's conditions as burdensome, leading to reluctance to engage with the agency.\nRajapaksa said Wednesday his government has weighed the advantages and disadvantages of working with the IMF, which has urged a \"credible and coherent strategy\" to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability.\nA restructuring is necessary as the debt levels are too high, said Kenneth Akintewe, head of Asian sovereign debt at abrdn in Singapore.\n\"The country doesn't have a history of defaults but that also means they don't have experience with going through the restructuring process,\" he said. \"Added to that, the relationship with the IMF has been a fractured one. This leaves room for missteps along the way.\"\n With assistance by Asantha Sirimanne, Lilian Karunungan, and Ronojoy Mazumdar\nDisclaimer: This article first appeared on Bloomberg, and is published by special syndication arrangement.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/17/sri_lanka-bloomberg-1.jpg"}

Eggs in Dhaka are 7.34% costlier than in Dayton and 29% costlier than in Cyberjaya.\nSimilarly, per kilogram of onion costs Tk55.22 in Dhaka, which is Tk40.9 in Belgrade of Serbia and Tk37.46 in Baku of Azerbaijan. The key cooking ingredient is 35% costlier in Dhaka than in Belgrade and 47.41% costlier than in Baku.\nThis is how consumers of Dhaka are bound to pay more for commodities than in other countries  whether they are imported or produced locally, as explained by Dr Fahmida Khatun, executive director at the CPD.\n\n\nPresenting a keynote at a press briefing organised by the CPD on Sunday, she said traders are hiking prices of most commodities unreasonably on the pretext of increasing prices in the global market.\nShe said, \"Sometimes, the degree of increase in the prices of essentials surpasses the global rate. On this occasion, the prices of non-imported goods also went up.\"\n\n\n\n\nDr Fahmida said the monthly average earnings of employees in Dhaka was $149 in 2017, which was $3,955 in Dayton. Consumers in US towns have the opportunity to buy eggs at a lower price, despite 26.54 times higher income.\nCommodities are being sold at unusually high prices in Bangladesh, but there is no reflection in the BBS inflation report.\n\n\nShe further said there is a strong relationship between prices of food and non-food items. Rising food inflation would accelerate non-food inflation as well.\n\n\nThe BBS claimed food inflation was stable at below 5.3% for the last four months. But price hikes of some items are very high, even up to 30%, Fahmida noted.\nHer paper further revealed that the price of rice is increasing steadily with some fluctuations, but it is rising moderately in Thailand and Vietnam.\n\n\nIn January, rice was sold at Tk34 per kg in Vietnam and at Tk35-Tk37 per kg in Thailand. But the price was Tk51-Tk69 in Bangladesh.\nShe found the same picture in the case of flour.\nThe price of per litre edible oil was Tk134 both in global and local markets in May last year.

The liquid item is 28% costlier in Dhaka, despite the earnings of its residents being only 6.60% of Spain.\nFahmida Khatun said the income of the poor and fixed wage earners in Dhaka is much lower than that of the people in other countries. Their actual purchasing capacity is even lower as they are having to buy products at higher prices.\nThere are weaknesses in market management and tax structure.

I am talking about a time around 15 years ago. She used to live alone as her husband was a private job holder, whose life was dragged from pillar to post because of the nature of his job, while her only son, back then, was a student of a residential educational institute. That forlorn lady used to feel a bit under the weather around the year.\nStarting from a minor headache, which was an outcome of her tendency to stay awake throughout the night thinking about her husband and son who were away from her, the problem later turned into a serious sickness.\nShe developed chronic insomnia, migraine and other comorbidities associated with such illness. She consulted several high-profile and renowned doctors, all of whom only prescribed her tons of medicines.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, her sickness was the consequence of her inability to stay together with her family and more interestingly, no doctor ever bothered to delve deep into the patient's psychology and put their fingers on what was wrong with her.\nThe other day my wife went to a consultation centre to see a paediatrician. As we have twins, it's quite difficult for my wife to manage them single-handedly. So, very naturally, we are giving them formula milk along with colostrum to satiate their hunger as it's practically impossible for a mother to breastfeed twin babies all day long at a stretch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas is a usual concomitant of formula milk. When we consulted the doctor, the doctor came down heavily on the nursing mom without taking into cognisance the travails of the mother and other pressures the lactating mother is sucked into.\nInstead of prescribing any medicine, the doctor dished out a few suggestions  keep a governess/babysitter or hire a nurse so that you can give more time to the babies, which is not a financially viable option for us.\n\n\n\nNow, give it a thought  is it possible for someone belonging to the lowest rungs of the social ladder or hailing from rural subalterns to hire a babysitter? When a doctor provides such a suggestion turning a blind eye to the psychological state of the patient, how effective will his/her treatment be?\n\n\n\nWhen someone gets sick, he/she sees a doctor, while the doctor prescribes medicines after the necessary diagnosis. This is the most common way of treating patients in medical science.\nHowever, I think this practice fails to address the whole picture. From my vantage point, while treating a patient, the mentality or psychology of the patient must be taken into account.\n\n\n\nIn many cases of complications and sickness, psychology plays an important role and this needs to be properly addressed in the treatment process. For example  when you are treating a baby, it's important that the doctor understands the psychological situation of the parents because the wellness of a baby depends greatly on the wellness of the parents as well.\nSo, if a paediatrician cannot relate to the parents, then it will be difficult to cure any illness of the baby completely, as the parents will run out of steam.\nSimilarly, there are many cases when the doctors must understand the history of illness of the patient to treat him/her properly and determine the prognosis.\nIf the doctor does not spend a few minutes with the patient to know about his/her history, how will he or she be able to cure him? Whether you admit it or not, only medications are not actually enough to cure a patient in many cases.\nThis psychological connection with the patients is missing in our healthcare system. The doctors are, I think, missing this important piece of the puzzle that needs to be put together with other pieces, such as medication, diagnostic tests and necessary therapy, while treating a patient. Let me put it in a more comprehensible way.\nThere is an adage that 'don't hide anything from the doctor'. This is important because if you do not open up to the doctor, he or she will not be able to figure out your problem in the truest sense.\nThe problem is, many of the patients nowadays are eager about opening up, but the irony is that the doctors mostly do not show interest in hearing those woes of the patients.\nRather, they suggest diagnostic tests and prescribe medicines based on the reports only. So, the unheard and unexpressed stories of afflictions (of the patients) go mostly unnoticed.\nFor solving any crisis or problem, you need to take the associated issues and the surroundings into consideration. Similarly, the doctors need to consider the psychology of the patient because many of our illnesses stem from our mental turmoil.\nDr James Groves, a psychiatry specialist based in Boston with over 50 years of hands-on professional medical experience under his belt, once said, \"Emotional reactions to patients cannot simply be wished away, nor is it good medicine to pretend that they do not exist.\"\nSo, while treatment is underway, both the doctors and the patients need to understand each other. Recuperation is a journey and there will be many bumps in this road. To weather those, healthy and constructive interactions between the doctor and the person receiving the treatment are imperative and may result in the improved patient-physician relationship, which has the potential to yield better clinical outcomes during the period of convalescence.\nThis part of the physician-patient relationship is greatly ignored in our country. Our doctors are very professional these days and they don't have time to listen to the patients, which could otherwise have been a game-changer in making a proper diagnosis and determining the course of treatment.\nI have personally approached many doctors in many instances and tried to open my heart out to them. Most of them exhibited a stolid response and started getting the advice and medications down in the prescription even before I finished my words. This is a common practice nowadays.\nDoctors are the group of people we resort to in times of trouble and plead for a solution with great hopes when we get sick. The doctors need to realise the fact that cross-sections of people count on them, so they should be more empathetic to the patients.\nJust a simple gesture of empathy can instil the confidence in the patients that you, as a doctor, really care for the patient and will do whatever is necessary to take the edge off their pain.\nDoctors should not behave in a way that will blow the wind off the convalescents' sails. Treating patients without taking notice of their emotional nuances is like flogging a dead horse.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMd Morshedul Alam Mohabat is a philomath who likes to delve deeper into the human psyche to explore the factors that influence it.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and views of The Business Standard.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/23/thoughts-illustration.png"}

Even back in 1971, cultural activists did not sit idle.\nAt a time when everyone's role was critical, cultural activists followed an unconventional path and set up the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra. Starting off as a simple temporary radio station, this turned into an emblem of grit and indomitable spirit for the freedom fighters and cross-sections of people as well.\nStruggles at the nascent stage\n\n\nThe journey of this radio centre, widely known as Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra, began on 26 March 1971. When the despotic Pakistani rulers let their barbaric army loose upon innocent Bangalees to carry out a massive massacre against us, the declaration of the independence of Bangladesh came from the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra (SBBK) located in Kalurghat, Chattogram on 26 March 1971.\nAmidst the tumultuous events that were going on everywhere, this radio centre kept informing people about the updates of the war. However, it was heavily shelled by the Pakistan military on 30 March, 1971.\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, despite the bombing, a 1-koilowatt transmitter was intact that was later carried to a jungle located in Agartala. Rashidul Hussain, one of the ten members behind the initiative, strained every muscle in his body to set up the radio again with that transmitter and the operation of the radio station was conducted from there for a few days.\nNandini Satpathy, a minister attached to the former Indian premier Indira Gandhi with her specific portfolio being the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, called on the activists and observed their activities. She was astonished by their efforts to reinstall the devices to run the radio station.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tajuddin Ahmad and Barrister Amirul Islam entered India through the border. Tajuddin requested a high-capacity transmitter for the radio station. Responding to his request, Indira Gandhi provided a 50-kilowatt medium wave transmitter which was later set up in a house located at Ballygunge Circular Road, Kolkata.\n\n\nThe final phase of Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra was formally initiated on 25 May 1971. This is how a clandestine radio centre in Kolkata known as 'Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra' came into being.\nHowever, it was not easy for those working at Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra to keep broadcasting programmes and running news during the initial days. Especially, when it came to news collection, it was quite an arduous task as the station was based in Kolkata. Political leaders used to visit the border areas of East Pakistan to meet people living there and people working at the radio centre used to coordinate with them to collect first-hand accounts of the incidents happening in the war field.\n\n\nSometimes, some courageous people also trespassed into areas that were cordoned off and interviewed people which were then broadcast from Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra. Meanwhile, different political leaders also delivered speeches from this radio.\nSwadhin Bangla Betar Kendra  the snowball effect\nThis radio centre was a classic example of how a simple radio centre could revitalise a whole nation and turn into a great source of encouragement in the face of a tremendous calamity that was the war. In the first place, songs broadcast from here kept the morale of the freedom fighters up.\nMusic is something that we can easily relate to and nothing touches us more powerfully than a soothing piece of music. This was also true for the freedom fighters. At a time when we were in the middle of an uneven fight, the lyrics of the songs of liberation war had definitely whetted the appetite of the freedom fighters to keep fighting as songs such as Ek Shagor Rokter Binimoye, Purbo Digonte Surjo Utheche and Mora Ekti Phul Ke Bachabo Bole Juddho Kori played instrumental roles in instilling a sense of nationalism in those fighting from the front.\nSecondly, this radio centre also kept the whole nation united during the war. People stuck in different places of the country were in a state of confusion and many of them did not have any idea about what's actually going on in the battle fields. Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra circulated news items to keep cross-sections of people updated with the news of the liberation struggle.\nWithin a very short period, the Betar Kendra turned into a source of ineffable inspiration and courage for all. During the war, it was very natural to feel low sometimes, but it was those songs of freedom that helped people to stay hopeful.\nThirdly, the role of Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra in forming optics in favor of the independence of the country is undeniable. Programmes like Charampatra had enormous impact both nationally and internationally. It was also a direct protest to the atrocities carried out by the Pakistani occupation forces. The radio station became a source for the truth about the war and international communities took notice of the barbaric activities of the Pakistani rulers as a result.\nHow it is relevant even today\nSwadhin Bangla Betar Kendra reflects the importance of free media and how the existence of a free and fair media can change the fate of a whole nation. This is relevant more than ever now. Consider the Digital Security Act (DSA), which has been abused in recent days to gag the media and those who want to take the bull by the horns, stand up and be counted.\nAt a time of crisis, it is the mass media that can rise up to the occasion and catalyse greater events for the welfare of the nation. If it goes sideways or the state tries to control it, it results in unpleasant blowbacks. Especially when it comes to any momentous event, people count highly on the mass media. But, if mainstream media could not rise to the occasion and satisfy the readers' thirst for information, that is when social media begins to take over and the room for rumours and propaganda is created.\nThis is not good for a nation. After all, we have fought for our freedom  freedom that includes freedom of speech as well. On this auspicious occasion of the 51nd Independence Day of Bangladesh, let us commit to ourselves that we will uphold the spirit and make sure that freedom of speech and the media is being protected at any cost.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMd Morshedul Alam Mohabat\nMd Morshedul Alam Mohabat is a philomath who likes to delve deeper into the human psyche with a view to exploring the factors that influence it.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/26/betar-kendra.jpg"}

In a country where democratically elected leaders are regularly ousted from office, that should not be entirely surprising.\nYet this time it is. Although Prime Minister Imran Khan was elected in 2018 with only a slender majority in the National Assembly, he seemed likely to serve out his term without incident. His personal popularity was unquestioned. The economy appeared to have bottomed out. The opposition was divided and in disarray, with corruption cases against most of its senior leaders.\nMost importantly, Khan had the clear backing of Pakistan's powerful military. And, last year, Khan received a shot in the arm thanks to the disorderly US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which installed a friendly Taliban regime next door.\n\n\n\nNow Khanfacesa no-confidence motion brought by an enraged, united opposition that he might well lose. Even if he survives, he will find his political capital severely dented  and be even morein debtto the military.\nIn large measure, he has only himself to blame. Khan has been caught up in his own rhetoric. He stormed into office promising to build an Islamist welfare state, not a reform-minded and growth-focused modern economy. For decades, he had targeted the United States and the West as the source of Pakistan's problems and he did not tone down that rhetoric in office. He insisted that every other political leader was corrupt and, in Trumpian fashion, that he alone could fix Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis persecution of the opposition leadership created a strong incentive for parties and politicians who had long been rivals to unify. Meanwhile, despite all his anti-corruption rhetoric, many of his erstwhile supporters havenoticeda conspicuous lack of new evidence being unearthed or new criminal cases being filed against the leaders Khan promised to hold to account.\nBut the biggest problem is the economy. Pakistan has never been able to solve its dependence on imports. When its rupee depreciates or oil prices increase, it immediately faces intolerably high inflation  well over 12% now, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused spikes in commodity prices, ascomparedto an average of 5% or so in the five years before Khan took office.\n\n\n\nThe central bank's benchmark interest rate is touching 10%. The balance of payments may hit a record this year. The Pakistan rupee has lost about half its value since Khan took office.\n\n\n\nKhan's response has been characteristic: He hasannouncedsubsidies for petroleum products and electricity to cushion the impact on voters. Given his political promise was not responsible governance but a new welfare state, he could hardly have done otherwise.\nHis government and its partisans have responded angrily to suggestions that Pakistan's economy is in trouble. An official statement from the Finance Ministrydenounced\"fabricated narratives\" about the economy in the global media. They've implied that the pandemic and the Ukraine war are to blame for any difficulties.\n\n\n\nBut the fact is that growth was slowing sharply even before the Covid-19 pandemic, down from 6% in the financial year before Khan took office to just over 3% in 2018-19 and shrinking in 2019-20. Khan's welfare-focused profligacy hasn't helped. The fiscal deficit tops 7% and interest payments swallow up athirdof the federal budget.\nIn order to try and fill the fiscal gap without making politically disruptive changes to the direct tax base, Khan's government has focused on import taxes, which nowprovideover 40% of government revenue. But that has left Pakistan ever more disconnected from global value chains, which depend on both exports and imports being easy and minimally taxed.\nA country in such a precarious position would normally be able to turn to the International Monetary Fund or other global institutions for help. But how can Khan possibly admit he needs aid from the West? While Pakistan has signed up to a $6 billionbailoutfrom the IMF, Khan cannot be seen to undertake any of the reforms the Fund wants, as that would compromise his anti-Western stance.\nKhan's militant, Islamist, anti-West messaging is precisely what appealed to the military in the first place and is the reason they propped him up prior to his election victory. Therein lies Pakistan's tragedy. A civilian leader who seeks to modernize Pakistan's economy and open it up to the world will necessarily run afoul of an isolationist military. One who defies the generals by focusing on reform and liberalization won't last long in office.\nUntil civilian leaders can break free of the military's expectations and of populist anti-Western rhetoric, Pakistan will be condemned to regular economic and political crises. And Khan will not be the last prime minister to find his hold on power slipping away.\nMihir Sharmais a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

{"created_at": "26 March, 2022, 03:15 pm", "title": "51 years of independence: State of our public health", "description": "We have reached 51 years of the declaration of our independence with great pride. Throughout the decades we have achieved a lot of our rights which we had fought for. From rights to speech to living independently in all spheres of life, reducing social inequality and advancing human rights for creating a society with equity was the vision of our independence. Among many of our expectations, quality and equality in health service is a crucial one.\nOur healthcare situation has significantly improved over the past 50 years. We have achieved growth in average lifespan from less than 50 to above 70 years, thanks to increasing access to healthcare, increasing the number of hospitals and community clinics in the rural areas, reducing mortality rate, dropping child and maternal mortality, success in fighting tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrhea, smallpox, polio, rubeola and many more.\nA report by Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in 2019 found that after liberation our child mortality rate dropped from 221 deaths per 1000 live-births in 1972 to 38 deaths per 1000 live-births in recent years. It has also shown impressive improvements in population health status by achieving United Nations Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 by reducing child deaths before the 2015 target.\n\n\nThough the death rate is declining, Bangladesh still is far behind in ending preventable deaths of newborns and under-five children to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.2. Despite decreasing of emerging infectious diseases, other non-communicable diseases like cancer,lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, stroke, preterm birth complications, tuberculosis, neonatal encephalopathy, diabetes, and cirrhosis have been the major causes of death in Bangladesh, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC).\nOur healthcare system has indeed been significantly improved over the five decades, yet, quality and equality in healthcare is yet to be achieved which is another goal in SDG 2030. Health inequalities due to socioeconomic inequalities in our country have been revealed several ways, several times and the population of Bangladesh experiences discernable differences in health and longevity due to socioeconomic status differences.\n\n\n\n\nIt has affected people of poorer socioeconomic backgrounds, living in deprived locations both in the rural and urban areas, minority ethnic groups, and vulnerable groups of the society suffering the full force of unequal distribution of healthcare. In the past two years, the coronavirus pandemic has also confirmed the prevailing health inequalities in our country, even though Covid-19 has impacted every person, group, and community. But the impact has been different on different social classes.\nFor communities who experience vulnerability and marginalization, the challenges have been aggravated even further by the pandemic. According to a report of Leave No One Behind (LNOB) Network, people belonging to ethnic minority and sex workers faced discrimination at public hospitals during the peak period of the pandemic.\n\n\nOur country is also critically suffering from both a shortage of health workers and disproportionate distribution of hospitals and health service institutions. Here, we get only six doctors and four nurses per 10,000 patients, an extremely low ratio. In the early years of independence, the healthcare system in Bangladesh concentrated largely on the health service requirements of rural areas. The first Five-Year-Plan (1973- 78) emphasised on building a network of health facilities establishing a hospital in every district, accompanied by a Maternal and Child Welfare Centre (MCWC), and an Upazila Health Complex (UHC) in every Upazila.\n\n\n51 years later, 70 percent of our population still resides in rural areas and the rest in thecities. Yet, the healthcare sector is heavily concentrated in Dhaka. The rural people are deprived of quality health, as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The treatment and medicine facilities in the government hospitals and community hospitals are also mostly in the peripheral areas.\nAs a result, people are rushing to metropolitan areas for treatment and the hospitals are struggling to accommodate the patients and provide services. According to the quality healthcare ranking by WHO, Bangladesh ranked 88th, which is better than any of the SAARC countries, and even better than India, which is ranked at 112. Bangladeshi patients still spend two billion dollars a year in India for medical treatment.\n\n\nThe health financing system in Bangladesh is quite underfunded in the proportion of the need of an increasing population and demand and modernization. In terms of healthcare financing policies, Bangladesh follows a combination of general revenue taxation, the donation from development partner countries, and comprehensively depends on the 'out of pocket-payment' (OOP) system. The funding for mental health is even less effective, with the mental health expenses being only 0.44 percent of the total health budget. The same is true for adolescent healthcare, which is yet to be introduced in the national healthcare budget.\nAlthough public health care expenditure in Bangladesh has significant focus on benefiting poorer people, it is not distributed fairly in accordance with the needs of the citizens of all classes. Since poorer people tend to suffer more from health problems, they have a greater need for healthcare. Additionally, we see that lower socioeconomic status is associated with higher mortality compared to others of high socioeconomic status.\nThe socio-economic class differences in getting treatment have increased over the past decades after independence. There is substantial evidence regarding racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in health-related behaviours, health status. The economic growth in our country is also not fully inclusive to all classes and income groups of people, which has an impact on the health status as well. In the absence of socially inclusive support packages and protection, the rapid economic growth has made the marginalized groups permanently poor.\nThe healthcare system in the country still lacks availability, equality and reliability. It has also been proven to lack affordability, particularly in the wake of Covid-19. The pandemic exposed many gaps in our healthcare system, including poor governance and monitoring system, corruption, inadequate healthcare facilities, and poor public health communications.\nThe health sector, nevertheless, has a huge potential for growth but for this to happen, measures should be taken through policy to overcome the obstacles and loopholes. The immediate need, however, is to improve the quality of healthcare in Bangladesh for all classes of citizens.\nThe Government of Bangladesh has a plan to introduce a public health card system along with a coalition with NGOs working in the rural areas and vulnerable groups that would be inclusive ofmarginalized groups, enabling them to access community healthcare services. If the government succeeds in implementing this system, that would represent a major improvement inaccessibility of public health.\nAdditionally, the budget allotted for the sector should be adequate. Stopping the misuse of the allocated resources is also important. Increasing the number of secondary, and tertiary hospitals, supported by the necessary number of doctors and nurses, well-equipped intensive care units in all hospitals at the district and upazila-level remain vital.\nOffering incentives to the healthcare workers willing to work in remote and rural areas, or with marginalized groups can be a very effective tool for achieving decentralisation. Other steps necessary for a modern system include introducing patient referral system through digital communication and connectivity in primary, secondary and tertiary hospitals, ensuring health care insurance system for all citizens and finally, monitoring and evaluating the healthcare system centrally to prevent corruption and establishing robust service.\nWe also need to encourage people to seek medical treatment in government hospitals. But to attract patients, these facilities need to have skilled doctors, equipment, diagnostic facilities, healthier and patient-friendly environments.\nInitiatives also should be taken toward foreign partnerships, with the health authorities actively encouraging foreign investment with ain to modernize our hospitals. The government should also consider announcing an inclusive social package during any unstable socio-economic situation and environmental disasters. Overall, Bangladesh must aim for a better score on the healthcare index and do whatever it is necessary to achieve this.\n\nProfessor Dr AHM Amanullah is a Sociologist and Public Health Researcher at the Department of Sociology, University of Dhaka.\nLaboni Khatun is a development worker and MPhil Researcher, Department of Sociology, University of Dhaka.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/26/oxygen__0.jpg"}

{"created_at": "25 March, 2022, 03:10 pm", "title": "Is a new global recession the price for punishing Putin?", "description": "Hanging tough against Vladimir Putin was never going to be cost free. Energy prices are soaring, firms are pulling out of Russia and those that stay are at risk of nationalisation. There's concern about global food supplies. Recession chatter has started, even as the world economy is still mopping up from the last one. It would be foolish to discount a fresh slump  if it isn't already upon us.\nThe \"R-word\" was deployed a couple of times Tuesday: International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva acknowledged risks are growing in a number of countries and Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists warned in a paper that the global economy likely won't be able to avoid a slump, absent a resumption of Russian energy exports this year. Ultimately, that depends on how much pain the US and its partners are prepared to endure to punish the Russian president for his invasion of Ukraine.\nOn the face of it, the world economy has some cushion before things get dire. The IMF projects an expansion this year of 4.4 percent, down from last year's blockbuster 5.9 percent, but another universe from 2020's pandemic-induced crater. A few important caveats: The lender's definition of global recession is growth of 2.5 percent or lower  not an outright contraction  and the fund is almost certain to cut its forecasts next month. While arrival in recession territory is unlikely then, the direction of travel may point that way.\n\n\nDallas Fed economists Lutz Kilian and Michael Plante wrote that the prospective downturn could be more protracted than in 1991, the year that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. \"If the bulk of Russian energy exports is off the market for the remainder of 2022, a global economic downturn seems unavoidable,\" they wrote. Three decades ago, Saudi Arabia was able to ease some dislocations in the market by ramping up production. The US endured a relatively modest recession and was growing by the end of 1991, though the recovery didn't become apparent quickly enough for then-President George Bush, who lost the 1992 election to Bill Clinton.\nBush later blamed Alan Greenspan, the Fed chair at the time, for keeping credit too tight. Might current chief Jerome Powell adjust his approach and take out a little insurance against a downturn? There is little sign of that in public remarks. If anything, the opposite. Speaking to the National Association for Business Economics, Powell sounded more aggressive than his relatively hawkish press conference last week after the Fed hiked its benchmark rate by a quarter point. He said Tuesday he's prepared to consider half-point steps at the next few meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee to rein in inflation. \"What would prevent us? Nothing: Executive summary,\" Powell said, pushing an already hammered bond market lower.\n\n\n\n\nPowell said last week the labour market is strong to an unhealthy level, leaving little room for ambiguity about the priority now given to curbing inflation. It is strong: the jobless rate fell to less than 4 percent last month and gains in payrolls were way above estimate. But Powell can't afford to just worry about the US economy, even though that is the mandate given the Fed by Congress. As custodian of the world's largest economy, and the planet's reserve currency, he carries a larger burden. Many central banks look to the Fed for direction, if not guidance.\nHigher interest rates were coming before Putin began his assault on Ukraine. Monetary authorities began withdrawing accommodation last year, and some, like the Bank of England, lifted borrowing costs before the Fed. But Putin's name is on most of the hikes to some degree; most say the attack on Ukraine is, at the very least, exacerbating price pressures. The recession, should it arrive, will have his initials somewhere on the page.\n\n\nThe BOE was rightly scolded for its communication fiascoes in November when it appeared to signal, and then backed away, from a hike. More recently, the bank may be reading the hymn sheet a little better. Officials hiked this month, but began to soften their language. There may not be an enormous amount to come, was the import. The threats to growth appear to have registered in London.\n\n\nPowell's \"executive summary\" was awfully short and drew laughter from the audience. If he is wrong on the outlook, there will be less hilarity.\n\nDaniel Moss is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian economies.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: This article first appeared on Bloomberg, and is published by special syndication arrangement.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/25/market_economy.jpg"}

Health officials also aligned themselves with these rather political decisions instead of relying on concrete science-based decisions.\nMarch 11 marked 2 years of the Covid-19 pandemic. On this fateful day in 2020, WHO declared the Covid-19 outbreak as a global pandemic. Soon the virus spread throughout continents and despite intermittent periods of lockdown and other precautionary measures, different strains of this resurgent virus claimed millions of lives.\nTo date, as per official count, globally a total of 472 million have been infected and over 6 million people have died and the virus remains prevalent in many parts of the world. The actual number may be much higher.\n\n\n\nThe WHO repeatedly mentioned that the pandemic is not over yet. The virus changes its characters by changing the codes of its genome and attacks humans more aggressively with each progressive mutation leading to many people experiencing repeated infections.\nKudos to the scientists, physicians, allied health workers, journalists and many others for their non-stop work to come up with multiple arsenals such as diagnostic tools, vaccines, antiviral agents as well as public health messaging and data sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven during this disastrous time, some world leaders prefer to engage in war and it seems it is more important to them than the wellbeing of their people by uprooting this virus completely. War is not part of my discussion today. I would leave this to political scientists to write about it. Being a clinical scientist, I would like to write about the politics of masks.\nPeople in the Western developed countries have a sense of entitlement and usually have interesting opinions on any issue and Covid-19 was not any different. There have been controversies surrounding unauthorised treatments like hydroxychloroquine, the efficacy of vaccines and finally, vaccine and mask mandates.\n\n\n\nSince the beginning of this pandemic, one minority group was always against vaccines as well as mask use. It seems this public health mandate interferes with their freedom. Public health mandate is for the common good and unless there is a legitimate medical issue, I truly do not understand what it has to do with their freedom.\n\n\n\nNow the question is, should we let our guard down by easing Covid-19 health guidelines and put the ordinary people, especially the elderly, the immunocompromised and the unvaccinated in danger? Or should we develop a more cautious approach, based on rigorous scientific facts, for lifting public health mandates? Being a scientist, I will support the latter.\nOn one hand, many countries are beginning to lift the mask mandates. At the same time, Covid-19 is raging through many others. Countries like South Korea did a stellar job of managing the first phase of the pandemic. Unfortunately, they are now going through arguably the worst phase of Covid-19 outbreaks. On 17 March alone, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported a staggering new daily record of 621,317 for Covid-19 cases and 319 deaths.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea is not alone. Other countries experiencing surges in Covid-19 cases are China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom to name a few. However, most of the countries are seeing the decline of new peaks in a short time.\nAll of these countries are experiencing an outbreak of the Omicron variant along with a new sub-lineage of Omicron called BA.2. It is also noticeable that the United Kingdom experienced multiple surges over the last two years despite having a robust health care system. So taking this virus lightly is not an option.\nDr Anthony Fauci, the US White House chief medical advisor, mentioned in one of his recent TV interviews that \"the BA.2 variant has a transmissibility 50% to 60% higher than the original omicron variant. This means it will, over time, become the dominant strain.\"\nHowever, the good news is, he also said \"BA.2 does not seem to cause more serious illness than the original omicron variant, nor is it more resistant to vaccines or prior infections.\" Increased cases in any country with this BA.2 variant is likely and this sublineage is capable of causing serious infection in people who have no immunity against SARS CoV-2.\nRight now many countries are seeing the decline of Covid-19 related cases and deaths as well as hospitalisation rates and fortunately, Bangladesh is among them.\nBut does that mean Bangladesh should also let its guards down like the Western nations?\nDefinitely not.\nThere is still no guarantee of immunity against this virus and we don't know whether Bangladesh will experience a BA.2 surge like many countries mentioned above.\nMultiple studies conducted on the use of masks found no negative health impacts of wearing masks.\nMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) is one of the US CDC's main message disseminating tools where extraordinary research data are being published for the quick dissemination of information globally. Multiple studies on the uses of masks were published in MMWR and all of them showed that an appropriately fitted mask can decrease potentially infectious aerosol by about 95%.\nFurther studies showed that consistently wearing a comfortable, well-fitting face mask or respirator in indoor public settings prevents infection to Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses.\nWell-fitted masks provide added level of protection against acquisitions of SARS CoV-2 infections. Room ventilation will add further benefits. The latest MMWR article on masks also showed N95/KN95 masks offer the best protection followed by surgical masks and cloth masks respectively.\nIn conclusion, I think it is too early to lift the mask mandates. When masks are worn and combined with other recommended mitigation measures, they protect not only the wearer but also the greater community.\nIn circumstances with poor ventilation, typically indoor enclosed spaces where an infected person is present for an extended period, the concentrations of these small droplets and particles can build sufficiently to transmit infection.\nOlder age groups with chronic infections, the immunocompromised patients as well as the unvaccinated population will be the most vulnerable if exposed for a long period in crowded indoor spaces. I am glad to know that Bangladesh is not jumping on the mask mandate lifting bandwagon soon.\nThe use of masks in crowded indoor settings or dusty areas will not only help to protect from SARS CoV-2 infection, but it will also protect from many other respiratory pathogens such as Influenza viruses and tuberculosis to name a few and will provide protection against particulate matters which is way higher in big cities in Bangladesh.\n\nDr Muhammad Morshed is a Clinical Professor, at the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia.\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and views of The Business Standard.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/25/dr_murshed_1.png"}

Photo: Masum Billah\nThese groups also conduct trekking tours in the Chattogram hill tracks on weekends.\nAnd if you ask any of the group operators who led their teams to Mirsarai's Sonaichhari trail in Chattogram about Joynal Abedin, they will, invariably, have a lot of stories to tell you.\nHe is now quite famous among the hiking groups.\nHow the village grocer found an alternative livelihood\nThe day we walked this trail in early March, our team had 40 hikers, including women and teenagers.\nWith such big teams, you will not enjoy the bliss of silence, the chirping of crickets, the rhythmic tune of cascading water or have the space to take in the majesty of desolate rocks.\nHuman cacophony will drown out the harmony of nature; it is what it is.\nHowever, the number of hikers on this trail has been increasing exponentially in the last few years. And that has changed the game for village grocer Joynal.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nJoynal serving lunch to Sonaichaari hikers. Photo: Courtesy\nIftakhar Hamid, team leader of a renowned Facebook-based tour group named Shopnoghuri, was leading our team.\n\"I met Joynal three years ago when I came with my team in Shonaichaari for the first time. Since his grocery stall is the last store before the trail, we stopped there to buy water and other essentials. Joynal approached me asking if we wanted to have lunch at his place.\nAnd ever since, every time I come here, he hosts and prepares our food,\" said Iftakhar, adding \"In three years, I saw how the tourists have changed the life of Joynal. He used to live in a mud house back then, and now he has a nice tin-shed structure.\"\nWhen we reached his house after the day's hike, Joynal, along with his wife and sons, were busy serving food to our team. We found another hungry team already waiting to eat.\nJoynal, now a 45-year-old man, did not get the scope to study much when he turned to business at 15.\nHe used to sell bread, tea and a few other food items on the hill by the Sonaichhari trail.\n\"Back then, 200/300 people from the village used to go to the hills to cut trees and bamboo. I used to carry my shop on my shoulder to the hills to reach those customers,\" Joynal reminisced about his childhood.\nFerrying tea to hill workers cannot earn you much; poverty was Joynal's inevitable companion.\nSo a few years after he married, about a decade ago, he launched a permanent store near the trail. He also built a mud house near the stall to live in.\n\"Back then there were not many tourists. Only a few would come to this trail. So I depended entirely on my grocery store,\" Joynal said, \"things changed only three to four years ago when a lot of tourists began to come and I got a new source of income by feeding them lunch.\"\nInitially, Joynal said, small teams of three to five people would come and ask if he could make them lunch. Gradually the number increased. \"From five to 10, then 15  and now people from all over Bangladesh call me before coming here to get lunch,\" Joynal said.\nBecause many people eat at his place every week, Joynal stores around 50 people's food in his fridge all the time.\n\"Many people come here without calling. They ask for food while passing my store,\" Joynal said. He stores food so that he does not miss out on these customers either.\nDue to the increasing number of tourists, you may not enjoy the trail as much as you would have liked it hiking alone.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHikers eating in Joynal's house. Photo: Iftakhar Hamid\nInstead of the sound of clicking bats overwhelming you at the bat cave in the middle of the trail, you will probably hear a teenage boy playing lousy Bollywood songs. If you are one of those hikers who wants to get closer to nature free of human noise, you should walk this trail on weekdays.\nBut in the backdrop of such human traffic at the Sonaicchari trail, some people like Joynal now have an alternative source of income.\nEven his sons, besides going to college, can contribute to family earnings by working as guides - when they don't have classes - for the hikers.\n\"They can earn a few hundred taka by guiding us on the trail. There are other people too who guide and host hikers for lunch on this trail,\" tour operator Iftakhar Hamid said, explaining how tourism is contributing to the income flow of the locals.\nIn Sonaichaari trail, however, none of the locals could make a name for themselves among the tourists as much as Joynal has.\nCapitalising on the new source of earning, he paid most of the loans he had taken while building his house, sent his kids to college and now anticipates an even brighter future ahead.\nJoynal said that \"Sometimes when tourists are few, I struggle to pay my loans. I have to pay my [house] loans for two more years. But more tourists will come in the rainy season. By the mercy of Allah and thanks to your prayers, I am doing very well.\"", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/24/photo_masum_a_long_queue_of_hikers_in_sonaichaari_trail.jpg"}

It does not meet the minimum requirements.\nIf there are not enough talking points on your rsum, what will the interview board talk to you about?\n\n\nThey will definitely not ask a marketing major what s/he learned from Philip Kotler's marketing book. They would like to know how you will navigate a difficult workplace situation.\n\n\nApart from having a degree you must have ancillary experiences and skills as well. You can opt for part-time jobs. You can also include tuitions as experience since you have patiently invested time and were paid for it. Be it a private home tutor or teaching at a coaching centre, it is okay to include it in your CV or rsum.\nEven if you do not have any work experience, you can talk about similar instances that arose in your university clubs which you may have handled strategically. If you can confidently answer questions extrapolated from your club work experience, you might land the job.\n\n\n\n'Not all co-curricular experiences apply to the real world'\nWafi Aziz Sattar\nChief Executive Officer, La Team Bee Communications\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking from an employer and former educator's perspective, extracurricular and co-curricular activities are great life experiences that teach students how to work in group environments. It teaches people how to work together and with each other in a synergistic work environment.\nClubs and apprenticeship programmes are great hubs for that.\nHowever, not all experiences gained from such programmes are always applicable to real-world work environments.\nEducational institutions should firstly understand this themselves, and then be transparent about it with their students. Students should also understand this fact and still try to take as much learning as possible from their extracurricular and co-curricular activities.\nIn terms of putting these experiences in a curriculum vitae (CV) or a rsum as work experience, I find it unfitting. In a CV or rsum, the first thing you should be put in is your actual work experience, followed by academic information, and only after this should the information about extracurricular and co-curricular activities and other information come in.\nIf you have no work experience whatsoever, put your academic information first, followed by extracurricular and co-curricular experiences and other information.\nOn another note, say if a student was a barista, to think they are less compatible for a job than a club president would be wrong.\nA barista not only has to prepare a drink, but also has to know about all the ingredients used in drinks, machines used to prepare the drinks, how to communicate with customers, and thereby, are far more in the know about a real job than someone who worked in an environment where the consequences of making a mistake was not dire and would not cost them or their management body or employer too much of a loss.\nMy advice, for everyone, would be to enjoy and learn as much as you can from extracurricular and co-curricular programmes, but not consider it as a selling point while seeking a job, or at an interview.\n\n'Co-curricular activities should not be depicted as professional experience'\nHasnaeen Rizvi Rahman\nFounder and CEO, ASTHA IT\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are applying for a programming job and also have taught programming, you can mention it as work experience in your rsum.\nIf you have experience that is not relevant to the job you are applying for, I would suggest not including it in your rsum. Recruiters might assume that the applicant does not understand the concept of a CV or a rsum.\nBe that as it may, If you are a fresh graduate and have no experience, you cannot just submit a blank CV or rsum. In this case, you have to utilise learnings from university and include it in your rsum. We all have worked on many projects in university.\nNo matter what discipline we come from, we indulge in a lot of research and group project activities. If such activities can be mentioned in the rsum in an enticing manner, it will add value to your prospects.\nYou can also include external certifications obtained besides your degree. Highlight your overall skills - softwares you specialise in, technical writing skills you possess, and so on.\nOverall, if you do not have any work experience, you should highlight whatever you have learned besides what your degree taught you, in a relevant way to the designation you are applying for. If you are applying for a marketing job, there is no point in highlighting your programming skills in your rsum. However, co-curricular activities should not be depicted as professional experience.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/17/co-curricular_activities.jpg"}

{"created_at": "25 March, 2022, 11:40 pm", "title": "Bracing for a prolonged fight against inflation", "description": "When crude prices soared to $80 a barrel in 2009, the then Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez said it was \"fair price\". In 2012, he said the global price of oil should stabilise at around $100 per barrel. Venezuela's oil industry has collapsed, but the prediction of its late leader now seems a reality. From the historic low during the pandemic, global crude price has now been well above $100 since the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in February. Top oil traders see oil prices may exceed $200, may even reach $250 by end-2022.\nEvery recession since the 1970s was preceded by an oil price hike. With Russian oil supplies to Europe likely to decline in the coming months, the crude oil market looks set to stay heated and the prevailing global situation gives a sense of dj vu about past incidences of recession.\nWhen oil prices skyrocket, both food and non-food commodities become costlier. The global market, reeling under the pandemic-induced supply crunch and high freight costs, has started feeling the heat from the Russia-Ukraine war, the third big blow to globalisation in a decade after US-China trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic. The ongoing war in Europe's breadbasket, besieged Black Sea ports and sanctions on Russia have triggered a supply shock not only on oil, gas and wheat to Europe, but also a range of goods such as nickel, steel and fertilisers to the rest of the world. The International Monetary Fund is set to cut its 4.4% global growth forecast for 2022 as a result of the war in Ukraine and sees recession risks in a growing number of countries.\n\n\nThe world is experiencing one of the worst bouts of inflation in decades, and food inflation this time looks more alarming as the war disrupted wheat and corn supplies from the world's two breadbaskets  Ukraine and Russia.\nFood inflation will be painful for grain importing countries as the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's food price index is close to the all-time high level of 1974  with wheat surging 65% in Europe, corn nearly 38% and palm oil 55%. However, benchmark rice prices are down almost 20%  a relief for half of the world's population who live on rice.\n\n\n\n\nIt is good news for Bangladesh, too, as local farmers produced good crops during recent seasons to create a buffer stock. Moreover, if some imports are needed, it would not be much harder to procure from the global market, unlike the 2007-08 crisis when rice export was almost stopped due to crop loss in major exporting countries in Asia.\nThere's enough rice this time around to keep global prices in check. \"Right now, rice is all that's standing between us and a full-blown food crisis,\" says a Bloomberg opinion piece, though it won't ease the market of wheat any time soon.\n\n\nAnother concern also remains high. Price of everything needed for crop production  from fertiliser to fuel for farm machinery  is surging, keeping fears of further global food inflation alive. Farming is becoming expensive and inflation is so rampant that even with rising food prices, farmers are facing increasingly tough margins, said a Bloomberg report a week ago.\n\n\nSky-high fertiliser prices have farmers worldwide scaling back its use and reducing the amount of land they are cultivating, which raise fears of food shortages in near future, says Reuters.\nCombined, Russia and Belarus accounted for more than 40% of global exports of potash last year. Moreover, Russia supplied about 22% of global exports of ammonia, 14% of urea and monoammonium phosphate (MAP)  all key kinds of fertilisers.\n\n\nWestern sanctions on Russia, a major exporter of potash, ammonia, urea and other soil nutrients, have disrupted shipments of those key inputs around the globe. Fertiliser is key to keeping corn, soy, rice and wheat yields high. Growers from Zimbabwe to Brazil to Canada are scrambling to adjust.\nIndia is turning to Canada and Israel to replace its Russian supplies of fertilisers, while Asia's major rice grower Thailand is facing pressure from fertiliser supply uncertainty.\nBangladesh is also an importer of fertilisers whose prices have already risen and any disruption in supply would put rice production at risk.\nWhat is the remedy, then?\nAs global prices are soaring, the Bangladesh government cut duties and taxes on a number of food items. But prices are still high. The government earlier said it would not cut farm subsidies to keep fertiliser prices stable at farmers' end.\nNational Board of Revenue Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem advised that people should remain prepared to buy necessities at higher prices, as reported by Bdnews24.com.\nCountries are trying different ways to protect consumers and farmers.\nPeople in one of our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka, are feeling the pinch hard of decade-high inflation. Policymakers there are facing the double whammy of rising prices and high debt, as the country is experiencing Asia's fastest growing inflation.\nSri Lanka's central bank in January raised borrowing costs to arrest price pressures in the economy and limit further contraction in growth.\nFacing a three-decade high in inflation, workers in Spain are suggesting a compromise solution  gradual salary increases to ease pressure on employers.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the UK, a 30-year-high inflation is seen as the biggest threat to the British economy, which has created pressure on policymakers to protect consumers from a tightening squeeze on living standards. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak has pledged to help the hardest-hit households with $28 billion of measures to clear electricity and gas bills.\nInflation was declared Public Enemy No 1 by US president Gerald Ford in 1974, the year following the 1973 oil crisis.\nNow, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is now in the hot seat as the world's largest economy is experiencing high inflation for the first time in the past 40 years. Hiking policy rate further would make borrowing costlier for inflation-hit consumers, who are already paying high prices for gas and groceries. Costlier borrowing will reduce consumer spending and slow pandemic recovery.\nFacing a crucial situation, former Fed chief Ben Bernanke in 2004 compared making monetary policy with driving an unfit car.\n\"...if making monetary policy is like driving a car, then the car is one that has an unreliable speedometer, a foggy windshield, and a tendency to respond unpredictably and with a delay to the accelerator or the brake,\" Bernanke said.\nTara Sinclair, professor of economics at the George Washington University, describes the situation using an analogy: \"Treating inflation in the economy is like treating cancer with chemotherapy. You have to kill parts of the economy to slow things down. It's not a pleasant treatment.\"\nA World Bank blog in February says inflationary surge is being felt in both advanced as well as emerging and developing economies, the world's major central banks must find a way out. But the task is not so easy for central banks at a time when the economy was just trying to overcome pandemic shocks.\nInflation thus has become a global problem with 78 out of 109 emerging and developing economies confronting annual inflation rates above 5%. Bangladesh is one of them, with inflation reaching 17-month high driven mainly by food price hikes.

Faced with imported commodity price increases to an extent and speed not seen since 2008-09, the government needed to have buffers to treat the pains caused by the transmission to domestic costs and prices. A modest budget surplus (around Tk1,100 crore), arising from 15.4% rise in revenue in nominal terms and almost flat (1% nominal growth) total government expenditures has provided just that.\nWhen bad is not so bad\nThis will not be good news under normal circumstances. The budget intended to run a deficit of Tk2,14,681 crore this fiscal year, equivalent to 5.4% of GDP (new series). Deficit failed to take off the ground in the first half not just towards the target but also relative to last year's Tk179 crore deficit during the same period. A fiscal contraction in absolute taka terms is not what an economy, clawing back from near sudden stop to a post pandemic normal, needs.\n\n\nThe definition of a new post-pandemic normal is now morphing into a post-war normal whose contours await discovery. The radical uncertainties created by the Russian War in Ukraine and the emergence of a complex web of sanctions have increased the risk of stagflation in Europe and developing countries, such as Bangladesh, who depend heavily on commodity imports for both production and consumption.\nStagflation is a period of high and rising inflation with declining or negative economic growth. It is what ravaged the global economy of the 1970s when inflation spun out of control during a period of high unemployment. Research by Larry Summers and Alex Domas shows that overheating conditions of high inflation and low unemployment, as is the case now in many advanced economies, are usually followed by recession. There are now new inflationary pressures from higher energy prices and sharp run ups in grain prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and perhaps more supply chain interruptions as Covid-19 forces lockdowns in major East Asian economies.\n\n\n\n\nThere is no vanilla fiscal policy response to mitigate the risk of stagflation. Policy makers face a miserable tradeoff between inflation and growth. A fiscal contraction, by running a budget surplus, can help tame inflation by decreasing aggregate demand. But it most likely will puncture growth and derail jobs recovery. A deficit could stimulate growth by boosting aggregate demand while increasing the pressure on inflation. Overheating the economy can boomerang by reinforcing stagflation and causing higher levels of average unemployment through time.\nThe way out\n\n\nFortunately, budget surplus or deficit is not the only mechanism through which fiscal policy can respond to incipient stagflationary pressures.The policy makers' dream is an instrument that will attack the root cause of the problem and thus overpower the tradeoff between growth and inflation.\n\n\nThe root cause of the problem is the import cost push. The government can use subsidies as an instrument to temporarily hibernate the pass through of international commodity price increase to domestic costs and prices. Such temporary increase in subsidies without denting the preexisting deficit target is possible when the original deficit target is not utilised at all.\nThis is the position Bangladesh was in at the beginning of 2022. Perhaps not exactly premeditated, but that does not matter. This is an advantage Bangladesh can use to mute the international price hike pass through of strategic items such as oil and gas to the domestic prices of oil, gas, and power administered by public monopolies and regulators.\n\n\nSubsidies can play the role of automatic stabilisers by caging the price increases from the ports of entry until the unknown unknowns about the trajectory of global commodity markets become more knowable.It is not an instrument orthodox economics recommends for fighting inflation. However, in the presence of administrative price controls and monopolised supply, orthodox economics is like an emperor without clothes.\nSubsidies unlikely to breach debt sustainability\nA rise in subsidies due to unchanged energy and power prices will most likely not breach the FY22 original budget deficit target. Total increase in subsidies to oil, gas, and power, if their domestic prices are maintained at current levels, are likely to range between Tk35,000 to Tk40,000 crores in the second half of the ongoing fiscal year. Increases of such magnitudes can be accommodated within the original FY23 budget deficit target even if the budget deficit in the second half of FY22 is almost 1.5 times the deficit in the second half of FY21.\nThe original FY22 budget deficit target passes the test of macro-fiscal sustainability. In addition to being authorised by the legislature, which is important politically, this is what makes staying on the targeted path desirable if the deficit is repurposed to absorb the import cost push in case of the strategic items. Such absorption will prevent the reverberation of the import cost push to the rest of the economy. These reverberations, if allowed to occur, will certainly fuel already increasing inflation, and take the momentum away from the recovery in growth.\nThe repurposing of the deficit need not necessarily be at the expense of other originally planned subsidies if the increase in subsidies merely fill the vacuum left by the inability to execute the development and other operating expenditures. Note that only 31.9% of the operating expenditure and 16.5% of development expenditure budgeted for FY22 were spent in the first half of FY22.\nBreathing space for reforms\nThe government has the breathing space to implement long standing reforms in the administered pricing, taxation, and subsidy regime in energy and power. To serve as efficient market signals, the world prices will have to be the drivers of changes in domestic prices, mediated by transparent domestic regulatory and taxation-cum-subsidy mechanisms that respectively cushion the volatilities (market mood swings) and internalise the externalities (carbon emissions).\nSubsidies under such a policy become a smart residual that rise from zero when the volatilities are on the upside and fall below zero when they are on the downside. If tailored to penalise differences in carbon emissions between different categories of dirty fuels, well designed pricing formulae can also make the polluters pay.\nThe execution of the reformed pricing mechanisms can start with the forthcoming new fiscal year (FY23). Hopefully, international commodity market prices by then will become much less noisy than they are currently. Even if they are not, knowledge of the price setting rules, backed by credible commitment to comply with them, will help make informed choices in markets besides depoliticising energy prices.\nThe government has a unique opportunity to build back better from a regime of ad hoc and often arbitrary decision-making in energy and power pricing.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2021/01/21/zahid-h-b-w_0.jpg"}

The economy had shown recovery signs recently though the demand for consumer goods declined owing to the pandemic-led income crunch.\nThen came the Russia-Ukraine war, delivering shock to the international fuel and food market, which has affected our domestic market too, dealing a fresh blow to the poor, low and middle-income people.\nMany middle-income people might not be able to buy goods as they used to. And our domestic demand might have to endure the overall negative effect.\n\n\n\nBut it is positive so far that rice prices have not increased much, and the country also has ample food stocks. Our Boro season is also ahead.\nIt is true the country's economy has grown well over the last two decades, but not everyone is reaping the benefits equally. This has resulted in a rich and ultra-rich class who may not be in significant trouble from the commodity price surge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it may not be possible to sustain the domestic demand if the poorer sections face decay in purchasing power. While large industrial groups are able to avert the crisis, companies that produce goods and services for the poor may be under pressure as demand falls.\nI think the supply-side crisis will affect the economy in the future. It prompted the current spiking inflation.\n\n\n\nIf fuel and petroleum become pricier, there is a concern over commodity price hikes. Unscrupulous traders also rush for hoarding to make a quick buck.\n\n\n\nThe government must strengthen market monitoring to provide consumers with some respites. Supply chain issues, if any, should be addressed promptly. It must be ensured that the price of an item does not multiply just after changing a few hands.\nMonetary policy also requires special care. Private sector credit should not be limited to large industries; it should be extended to small and medium enterprises.\n\n\n\nThe SME sector is the largest employer in the country; the sector also manufactures more goods and services for the poor. Both employment and income of the poor will decline if the SME sector suffers. Besides, commodity prices will also go up.\nThe monetary policy should not be too accommodative. Credit flow to unproductive sectors such as consumer loans, car loans and any purpose loans needs to be reduced.\nBesides, social safety programmes such as cash assistance, food aid and subsidised goods should be ramped up as part of fiscal measures to maintain the purchasing power of the poor.\n[Salehuddin Ahmed talked to The Business Standard Senior Reporter Jahidul Islam over the phone Thursday]", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/01/12/dr_saleh_uddin_ahmed.png"}

An immediate success led him to take on lease more lands to expand the cultivation.\nNow, in more than one decade, he has become a millionaire from a poor farmer. He has also built a medium-sized cattle farm with his profit.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, he received the President's Award for his contribution to agricultural development.\nInspired by him, many people in the area are now involved in grass cultivation and changing their economic fortunes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I now earn Tk2,000 to Tk3,000 every day by selling Napier grass only. There is already a demand for good grass in the area as there are many cattle farms nearby,\" Abdul Gafur told The Business Standard.\nAminul Islam Rintu, chairman of Palashbari upazila, said, \"Napier grass is being cultivated on about 300 acres of land in different villages including Sultanpur, Baripara, Kishoregari, Prajapara, Bara Shimultala, Dighalkandi, Kashiabari of Palashbari upazila.\"\n\n\n\nNot only in Gaibandha, farmers in other parts of the country are also cultivating these high yielding varieties of grass including Napier, Pakchong, Red Pakchong, Para and Jumbo developed by Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI).\n\n\n\nThe Department of Livestock Services (DLS) is working to expand the cultivation of these grasses at the field level.\nAccording to BLRI, Napier grass was first imported from India to Bangladesh in 1996. At first, it was given to Milk Vita for cultivation. The company started cultivating this grass on their lands across the country. From then on, the cultivation of this grass gradually spread in Bangladesh.\n\n\n\nNathu Ram Sarkar, former director-general of BLRI, told The Business Standard, \"BLRI is giving different varieties of grass to the farmers. The research of this institution has made a significant contribution to the cultivation of improved varieties of grass across the country.\"\nAccording to BLRI and DLS sources, the number of cattle farm entrepreneurs in the country has increased in the past years. On the other hand, the production of natural grass has also decreased due to the gradual reduction of cultivable land. As a result, the market for these high yielding varieties of grass has been created.\nThey said many people have also been involved in the processing of these grasses besides cultivation. So far, around 200 companies across the country have been set up in this regard.\nHowever, the DLS does not have the data on the total amount of land on which these grasses are being cultivated and the amount of grass that is being processed.\nMany farmers in Fakirhat upazila of Bagerhat have cultivated various improved varieties of grass.\nAccording to the local livestock office, in the first five months of the current financial year, 105 farmers cultivated grasses like Napier, Pakchang, Red Pakchang, Para and Jumbo on 10 acres of land in the upazila.\nHowever, the real amount of grass cultivation in the upazila is more as many farmers cultivate it on their personal initiative.\nAccording to farmers, the cost of cultivating grass on one bigha of land is Tk15,000 to Tk20,000. However, the grass cultivated on this land could be sold from Tk50,000 to Tk55,000. The grass becomes suitable for mowing every six weeks.\nTanjir Hasan has the largest commercial grass farm in Fakirhat. He is cultivating Jumbo, Red Pakchang, Pakchang-1 and Napier grass in about five and a half acres of land.\n\"The grass is packaged in a special process and stored in the warehouse due to high demand in the monsoon. The price of the grass is relatively high in July and August,\" Tanjir said.\nUpazila Animal Resources Officer Puspen Kumar Sikder said, \"There is no alternative to cultivating improved varieties of grass to meet the demand of farmers as the number of grazing lands is decreasing day by day. For this, we provide free improved grass cuttings to the farmers.\"\n\"Realising the commercial value of grass, we sent a proposal to the authorities to set up a marketing centre. If the proposal is approved, the marketing centre would be set up soon,\" he added.\nAccording to BLRI, the institute has developed different varieties of grass suitable for local production including Napier 1, Napier 2, Napier 3, Napier 4, Red Napier, Zara Napier, Pakchang.\nAccording to the Department of Livestock, in 2008-2009, the number of cows, goats, buffaloes and sheep in the country was 4.95 crore. In 2020-21, the number increased to 5.63 crores including 2.45 crore cows.\nPeople concerned say that at one time, almost every rural family used to rear cattle and goats. But the number has decreased in recent years. Most people are now rearing cattle and goats commercially.\nFormer Director-General of BLRI Nathu Ram Sarkar said, \"Many people in the country are now farming commercially. On the other hand, natural grass production is low. That is why farmers are becoming more interested in grass cultivation.\"", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/05/grass_cultivation.png"}

Now his team offers evidence to support the claim.\nWhile revealing the results of their study at a press conference on Wednesday, Prof Malo said people with IAP deficiency have a 13.8 times higher risk of developing diabetes.\n\n\n\n\nHe said the fasting sugar levels of people with low levels of the enzyme almost doubled during the research period.\nEven obese people do not get diabetes if the level of the IAP is high in them, he claimed.\n\n\nThe IAP level of a person can be detected within three-four minutes through a stool test, he continued.\n\n\nThose who are at risk due to the IAP enzyme deficiency can prevent getting diabetes by taking precautionary measures, he said.\nThe researcher sought cooperation from policymakers and the government for using the kit, which he has developed for doing the relevant test, at the field level.\n\n\nThe researchers think that providing the IAP enzyme to those with deficiency can help prevent diabetes.\nTests on mice have shown that consuming yellow and red capsicum increases IPA enzymes. However, it has not been clinically tested on humans yet, Prof Malo noted.\n\"We think this is a breakthrough which can greatly contribute to diabetes prevention,\" said Prof AK Azad, president of the Bangladesh Diabetic Association, at the press conference.\nThe study was recently published in the journal \"The BMJ Open Diabetes Research and Care\", a joint venture of the British Medical Journal and the American Diabetes Association.\nResearchers from Birdem, the Bangladesh Diabetic Association, Rajshahi University, Jahangirnagar University, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, and Harvard University were involved in the study.\nCurrently, there are 46 crore people with diabetes worldwide, while the number of diabetic patients in Bangladesh is more than 86 lakh.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2021/11/14/diabetic_diabetics.png"}

He first picked up the wicket of Kyle Verreynne with a rather poor delivery which Verreynne dragged in back to the stumps.\nBut his second wicket, where he dismissed Janneman Malan was a peach of a delivery with extra bounce and movement to have the batter caught behind.\nHis third wicket was of Dwaine Pretorius who was beaten by pace and the same was the case for the dangerous David Miller; his fifth victim was Kagiso Rabada.\nAfter finishing with figures of 5-35, Taskin said he tried to stick with his basics and it worked out for him on the day.\nHe was also adjudged as the player of the series for his excellent bowling in the first ODI too, which played a big role in the Tigers winning that match.\n\"Feeling happy and proud. This is the first time for me (getting)the Player of the Series (award). For the last one-and-half and two years, I have been following the same process.

Like many emerging nations, Bangladesh fell short capitalising off earlier industrial revolutions.\nMissing the current opportunity would be equivalent to living in the prehistoric era compared with countries who would take advantage of Industry 4.0. So, in this high stake game, Bangladeshi students must prepare for the future.\nWhen it comes to choosing professions or jobs, probably the larger portion would choose and prepare themselves for government jobs.\n\n\nWhile the socio-economic context makes government jobs the best option, civil service is outside the purview of this article's subject matter as we are dealing with jobs related to the fourth industrial revolution.\nThe Business Standard reached out to CEOs from various sectors to reflect on what role or position will have prominence in the decades to come. We specifically asked to pick one position they consider to have the most prospect and why these jobs will be important.\n\n\n\n\nBusiness and Product Development, Pharmaceutical industry\nOver the last ten years or so, price-competition in the generics industry has intensified worldwide.\n\n\nFor many companies, especially the smaller ones, return on investment is no longer particularly attractive. Moreover, niche opportunities, which were once the mainstay of smaller companies, are now being targeted by even the largest of generics behemoths.\n\n\nIn this regard, Kaiser Kabir, CEO of pharmaceutical company Renata Limited, said, \"In the future, specialty molecules, which permit some degree of product differentiation (and therefore less price competition) is likely to be the key thrust of corporate growth strategies. Therefore, a job designation that integrates business and product development is likely to gain prominence.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThis position demands a high-degree of scientific knowledge for two reasons - identifying molecules suitable for redesign on the basis of scientific reasoning and developing products on the basis of identified opportunities.\n\n\nIn order to prepare for this position, students should have a thorough knowledge in both biological and chemical sciences.\nAt present, our universities do not offer multidisciplinary degrees in the advanced sciences. Yet, such an approach develops essential skills needed to think seamlessly between the two disciplines.\nMoreover, in today's world, learning does not stop after graduation.\nThose who wish to succeed in the pharmaceutical industry must have the capacity to self-inculcate the latest developments in a wide variety of areas such as immunology, genomics, drug delivery, pharmacology, and so on.\nData Analyst, Corporate sector\nFor a developing economy, marketing and sales will always be important. Sales - either in person or digital  will be crucial. We need more people in digital marketing; reaching the target audience on social media through content. One other thing is supply chain management.\nHowever, this new era has thrust us into new options in the corporate sector. While these traditional roles of marketing, sales, and supply chain management will remain as important as these are today, big data analysis, in the corporate sector, is seeing rising demand.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Big data analysts will have a huge impact. Professionals related to these technologies will remain in high demand globally, and in Bangladesh, the demand will gradually rise,\" said Rupali Chowdhury, Managing Director of Berger Paints Bangladesh.\n\"Digital industries will face a lot of challenges to handle their data and thus, data analytics will play a big role behind making decisions easily, and implementing changes based on data. That is why such roles are very important in the corporate sector.\"\nShe added, \"they must have a strong foundation in computer science. Internet of things (IoT) and integration of business and technology is important.\"\nIndustrial Engineering, Readymade Garments\nProduction cost, in the RMG sector, is rising rapidly. Cost of labour, raw materials, and supply chain - all are on the rise. However, due to high competition in this sector, garment factories cannot hike prices.\nBangladesh's RMG is mostly dependent on cheap labour which is our main advantage. But labour will not be cheap anymore in the future.\nIn this situation, a position that can ensure most efficient output within an garments factory will be most important, said Shovon Islam, Mangaging Director of Sparrow Group.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\"This job holder will be responsible for efficiency, by making sure that the men-to-machine ratio is proper and operators are working to their best capabilities. Whoever does this exact job is said to be an industrial engineer (IE),\" said Shovon.\nMost of the big factories in Bangladesh have industrial engineers but, for most factories, this is not the case.\nBe that as it may, ultimately, IE will be the most demanding position in the garment sector. In fact, we have a tremendous shortage of well trained IEs. In many cases, we have to depend on Indian and Sri Lankan nationals.\n\"I think if someone focuses on this position, that will pay off in the future. I hope Bangladeshi IEs can fill up the positions.\"\nRobotics Process Automation, Information Technology\nThe way technology is moving forward, it is not easy to predict which job in the IT sector will be prominent.\nHowever, according to Ershadul Haque, CEO of prominent IT institution Riseup Labs, robotic process automation (RPA) will be in high demand.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the industries are focusing on automation and digital transformation. They are trying to automate their process using technologies to increase productivity and revenue,\" said Ershadul.\nAccording to him, students should select a technology, participate in different trainings, practice hands-on, get help from experts, stay updated with the global changes, stay focused on that technology and study different cases related to the technology, in order to be prepared to serve the global demand in the next five to 10 years.\nProduct Design and Facilitation, Agriculture\nDiptha Saha, founder and CEO of e-Khamar, an agro-based startup, broke down Bangladesh's agri sector into four quadrants - input (seed, fertiliser, medicine, supplement, machinery); advisory (agricultural extension services, veterinary support, an so on); finance (credit, loans, futures contract); and market linkage (selling the harvest in time at a reasonable price).\nIn this context, he said that product designer and facilitator positions will be important.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\"The sector needs new ideas and innovations to disrupt unpredictability and manual dependence on farming. As the manufacturing industry will boom, the demand for product designers will increase. Moreover, farmers are mostly offline and services will be accessible online in upcoming days. To bridge this gap, we will be in need of facilitators in these sectors.\"\nStudents of agriculture will require more technological knowledge to operate software and hardware. But professionals also need to learn the market and consumer behaviour. No farmer is going to pay for fancy technology or bookish advisory.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/24/pursuit_professions.jpg"}
{"created_at": "24 March, 2022, 11:30 am", "title": "Are too many students getting GPA 5?", "description": "Grade inflation refers to the practice of grading students at a level undeserving of their performance in the exams. Although not as serious as price inflation, academic grade inflation has become a concern in recent years with an overwhelming number of students achieving the highest grades in public examinations in Bangladesh.\nThis is particularly problematic given how it may lead to students overestimating their capabilities and becoming complacent.\nThat is not to say that grade inflation is exclusive to Bangladesh. The first case of grade inflation dates back to 1960 in the United States during the initial phases of the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\nIt is a particularly interesting case study. The US government needed to send more American troops into the East-Asian communist stronghold, although not many Americans were interested in laying down their lives in vain. So, the American government introduced a rather draconian rule requiring male students with a GPA below 3 out of 4 to be conscripted.\nTeachers - now under the pressure of students and their parents - began giving out higher grades so that the students could avoid being conscripted. And so began the journey of grade inflation as a political tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2016 survey in the United States found that high school students had an average GPA of 3.27 out of 4.0 scale in 1998, which rose to 3.38 in 2016. However, over the same period, the average SAT score fell from 1026 to 1002. This contradictory trend pointed towards a tendency among institutions to inflate grades for various reasons including increased funding from the government.\nLooking Eastward, our South Asian counterpart, India, appears to have similar problems. India has several education boards at the central and provincial levels. One particular case might interest the readers.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) introduced a new grading system for class X in 2010. Under this new system, 2.3 percent of about 1.6 million students got the highest grade A1, which rose to 9.84 percent in 2020.\n\n\n\nBangladesh, on the other hand, introduced the grading system at the secondary level in Bangladesh in 2001. About 0.6 million students participated in SSC or equivalent examinations that year, and 35.22 percent passed, of which only 76 students got the top grade A+. Approximately 2.2 million students sat for this exam in 2021. Among those 163,340 students bagged GPA-5, or 8.9 percent were top graders among the students who have passed.\nAt the HSC level, the GPA system was introduced in 2003. Students who passed the SSC examination in 2001 participated in the HSC examination of 2003, and only 20 students got GPA-5.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGPA 5 at SSC and HSC level. \nFast forward to 2022, 1,89,179 students received GPA-5, although 1,05,594 of them received the highest grade when they sat down for their SSC exams. The following chart shows the comparative number of GPA-5 in SSC in a year and HSC in the next two years. It shows a relatively inconsistent pattern of GPA-5 achievers.\nThat is not to say that the higher number of GPA-5 is entirely attributable to grade inflation. Definitely, with mass campaigns for education, subsidies for female education and the development of education infrastructure has contributed to an increased literacy rate and increased enrollment rates in Bangladeshi schools. These factors may also have led to an increasing number of students passing and getting GPA-5.\nHowever, no standardised test has been introduced in developing countries like ours to cross-check the quality of academic results as some other countries do. For example, there are SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) for students in the United States or GAOKAO (National College Entrance Exam) in China.\nNeither do we have such a system nor is there a database to measure the return on education for these students cross-tabulated by their passing year and grades. But it is intuitive to assume students overestimating their abilities and developing a false sense of competence is never the most ideal way forward.\nThere are systemic issues with the grading system which inherently lead to inflated grades. For instance, in Bangladesh, one only needs to score above 80 to receive the highest grade, while the threshold is much higher in other countries.\nFor instance, the standard grading in China and the United States has some five grades in the secondary level examinations. To be an A grader in a subject, one must score 90 to 100 percent. India and Indonesia have nine grades at the secondary level, and to get the highest grade, one has to achieve 90 to 100 percent. Some countries, including Israel and Jordan, require 95-100 percent marks to have the highest grade.\nIn the current context, along with all the efforts to foster qualitative change in education, the range for the top grade should be changed to 90-100 percent marks from 80-100 percent. Furthermore, passing students can be divided into different distribution formats.\nFor example, if a country has an eight-letter grading system, one-eighth of the passed students will remain in each grade in a particular subject. In this case, the competition for students to run for specific marks can be minimised as well.\n\nMd Rashedur Rahman Sardar is a PhD candidate, Department of Economics at Bryan School of Business and Economics at The University of North Carolina.\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and views of The Business Standard.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/24/md_rashedur_rahman_sardar.png"}

They simply cannot pronounce his name correctly.\nHe goes along with it, without correcting people every time they mispronounce his name. He was mad at his parents for giving him a name that is incomprehensible to the culture he was born into.\nHowever, when his teacher called him Daien, which is the correct way to shorten his name and also what his family calls him, he felt like someone was acknowledging his background and that felt good.\n\n\n\nNames are an integral part of our identity, and yet are constantly misspelt, mispronounced, anglicised and shortened. Altering one's name can have consequences that last for years.\nThat is why, in the age of shortcuts and nicknames, it is important to acknowledge how one wants to carry their identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNames might appear to be a minute detail in the grand scheme of things and hardly seem like something someone would blacklist you for. Yet, paying attention to it has become a valuable soft skill in professional environments.\nCultural significance\n\n\n\nA person's name carries more importance than just their identity, it is rooted in culture and history.\n\n\n\nNazia Manzoor, assistant professor at the Department of English and Modern Languages in NSU, said, \"Names are a marker of identity, they reveal who you are, and can be deeply political.\"\nAccording to Bangladesh's culture, some peoples' names are determined by family's elders. The name's meaning can be significant to the individual's religion or culture as well.\n\n\n\nIn some situations, people have to alter their names to be accepted in society. Be that as it may, there is a lot of emotion and history attached to their given names.\nMa Htay Oo, who belongs to the Rakhine community, said, \"Some adopt English or Bangla names. Sometimes our names get butchered or ridiculed, so we change it to avoid that.\"\nPutting in the effort to learn someone's name does not take much time, but it is the first step towards respecting the culture and roots of the people around you.\nNames and institutional consequences\nNames do not just determine our identity due to their cultural and religious significance, they also mark our identity in documents.\n\"In the eighth standard, I was sent a document to check if my parents' names were correct. My mother's name is Fahima,\" said Ruba Hassan, an NSU student, adding, \"but they misspelt her name as Fatima. I did not notice it back then because I was young.\"\nDuring her SSC exams, Ruba realised the mistake. To fix it, she had to fix her JSC certificate as well, which took two years. There was a lot of paperwork and money involved in the process.\nTwo years have passed since her application to correct her SSC certificate, and she is yet to see the outcome.\nMisspellings on documents are common in Bangladesh and its consequences can affect us for years and can be severe.\nIn marketing, one mistake can even impact the brand image. Tajdin Hassan, Daraz's chief marketing officer, said, \"It definitely tarnishes the brand's perception.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\nBuilds positive relationships\nThe people we work and study with are probably the people we spend most of our time with. It goes without saying that nurturing these relationships is always worth it. Taking the time to learn someone's name presents one as a genuinely caring person.\n\"I have had to shorten my name to Kai,\" said Kaishary Islam, adding, \"as people kept asking me for a simpler name. But sometimes, professors would ask me to repeat my name so they could pronounce my name correctly. When people put in the effort to get your name right, it makes you feel like you are more than someone who is just passing by.\"\nNetworking soft-skill\nWhen it comes to networking or interviewing people, paying attention to such details is the first step towards building connections.\nCreating connections often means building relationships with important people who have spent decades adding value to their name. There is a certain gravity to their names; at times, making them synonymous with their profession.\nSo when someone gets their name wrong, they have every right to take offence. On mistaking an interviewee's name, Journalist Afsan Chowdhury commented, \"It is the weakness of the reporter. I have observed that some people are sensitive regarding their name so it is best to make sure that you get the spelling right.\"\nFurthermore, it can unveil insufficient research, knowledge or interest in their field. Afsan also mentioned, \"It shows lack of competence and efficiency on the part of the journalist. There can be repercussions in some cases.\"\nWhile meeting industry experts, creating such an impression could lead to one losing their credibility and could risk tainting the image of the company they are representing.\nBecome a better leader\nIn the workspace, a team leader is bound to meet many people each day. When a leader acknowledges their team members by name, no matter how large the workforce, it is indicative that the leader sees their team as people rather than cogs.\n\"We see the characteristic of remembering names in leaders like politicians, as their work depends a lot on emotional intelligence. If you cannot remember the names of your workers, you are not a real leader,\" said Sadeka Halim, professor of the Department of Sociology and dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences of Dhaka University.\nTo this, Tajdin added, \"Knowing names and acknowledging their presence, regardless of their designation, is crucial. The most important thing to remember is that we are all humans at the end of the day and there is no easier way to form human connections than remembering names.\"\nIt is essential for a workforce to understand that their leader knows them in order to feel comfortable and invest time and effort in a workplace and names are the first step in that recognition.\nTaufiq Ul Haque, founder of Fraktal Creative LLC said, \"It upholds the company's image as an empathetic company that cares about its employees. It is because of this empathy and care that employees remain loyal to companies.\"\nIn Bangladesh's context, there are times when the designation title replaces one's name itself. This can make a workforce feel demoralised and disrespected. In such situations, it can probably feel like the entirety of one's identity is their job title and nothing more.\nThe impression you make on others matters because, in some ways, you are creating the legacy for your name along the way as well. So, when you go the extra mile in remembering how to pronounce someone's name, it makes you memorable in turn as well.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/17/name_student_writing.png"}

While one of them built an empire in telecom and retail, the other established a lock on transport and energy distribution.\nIncreasingly, though, the two billionaires from India's Gujarat state are starting to overlap, setting the stage for a clash that could alter the country's business landscape. Given the duo's proximity to politics, the shock is bound to reverberate through the corridors of power as well.\nIn the latest sign of their coalescing orbits, the Adani Group has discussed the idea of buying a stake in Saudi Aramco from the oil-rich kingdom's Public Investment Fund, potentially linking the investment to a broader tie-up or asset swap deal, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n\n\nThis is just months after Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd. and Aramco called off more than two years of talks to sell 20 per cent of the Indian conglomerate's oils-to-chemicals unit to the Saudi behemoth for about $20 billion to $25 billion-worth of Aramco shares.\nIn an attempt to cement the partnership, Reliance even got Aramco chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan to join its board as an independent director last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAramco, the No. 1 crude oil producer, is still a better fit with Ambani's Reliance, which owns the world's largest refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat. Reliance is also a leading manufacturer of polymers, polyester and fibre-intermediates.\nBut, Adani, too, has wanted to enter petrochemicals by putting up a $4 billion acrylics complex near his Mundra port in Gujarat in collaboration with BASF SE, Borealis AG, and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc. Covid-19 put a dampener on the plan.\n\n\n\nThis was not the first retreat from his petro-ambitions: Nothing also came of a plant in Gujarat, which was looking to rope in Taiwan's CPC Corp.\n\n\n\nAdani's main interest in hydrocarbons continues to be coal. He mines it in India and Indonesia, produces coal-fueled power at plants like the one in Mundra and berths vessels laden with the stuff at his vast network of ports. Exports of coal from the Carmichael mine would start soon, the group said in December, after slogging for a decade over the environmentally controversial project in Australia's Galilee Basin.\nBut while coal is very much India's past and present, it's not the future. Which is why Adani made a big bet on solar power. He also started circling around plastics.\n\n\n\nAfter Adani set up a new petrochemicals subsidiary last year, it became clear that sooner or later he was going to try and breach the moat of stable cash-flows established by the rival group's founder Dhirubhai Ambani, India's \"Polyester Prince\" (and father of Reliance's current boss). The tantalising question is whether Adani's ambitions include a refinery as well.\nBack in 2018, Aramco and Adnoc were going to partner with state-owned Indian firms to set up a mammoth $44-billion refinery. That plan has gone nowhere after the project lost its original site in India's Maharashtra state because of local political opposition.\nCould the Adani Group insert itself into a revival of that project? For now, the preliminary talks with Aramco seem to have a modest focus: collaboration in renewable energy, crop nutrients or chemicals, according to Bloomberg News. However, if Aramco is still keen on owning a captive refinery in India, the contours of its Adani partnership might well expand.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Graphics: Bloomberg \r\n\nThat would put the billionaires in direct competition  though not for the first time. In June last year, Ambani told his shareholders he was embarking on his life's \"most challenging\" undertaking by making a pivot to clean power and fuel. He followed up with a blitzkrieg of acquisitions in the field.\nBefore that, it was Adani who wanted to be the world's largest renewable energy producer by 2030. By revealing his plans for four gigafactories in Jamnagar  one each for solar panels, batteries, green hydrogen and fuel cells  Ambani put Reliance in the lead role in India's climate-change narrative.\nAnd he did it just before the COP26 summit in Glasgow where Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a bold commitment to lower the country's dependence on fossil fuels. Analysts like to clump Ambani and Adani together as a kind of India Inc. duopoly.\n\"By backing the '2As' at the expense of other companies, both domestic and foreign, the government is encouraging an extraordinary concentration of economic power,\" economist Arvind Subramanian, an adviser to the Modi administration until 2018, and Josh Felman, a former International Monetary Fund official in New Delhi, wrote in a recent Foreign Affairs article about how India's inward turn could stymie its rise.\nThe two superstar business groups are indeed reducing the competitive intensity in the broader economy by swallowing smaller and weaker firms adjacent to their operations. Still, every indication suggests they will compete fiercely against each other.\nAmbani took the telecom route to emerge as the czar of India's consumer data; Adani wants to come in from the other end by providing storage services to bits and bytes, powered by green energy. Ambani is engaged in a brutal contest with Amazon.com Inc. for control of the grocery supply chain.\nAdani warehouses grain for the state-run Food Corp. of India and owns the country's No. 1 edible oil brand.\nTheir balance sheets are different. For the past five years, firms linked to Adani have been hyperactive in the international debt market, borrowing more than any other Indian company. Ambani, meanwhile, has turned Reliance into a sparsely leveraged fortress  not a bad place to be as global interest rates harden.\nVisions are different, too. While Adani, 59, supplies grid power (and cooking gas, in partnership with with France's TotalEnergies SE) to households, Ambani, who's five years older, imagines a future in which \"every house, every farm, factory and habitat could, in principle, free itself from the grid by generating its own power.\"\nWill the two billionaires try to shape policies  and influence politics  according to their competing goals? You bet. A confrontation looks almost guaranteed. Investors in India should grab some popcorn.\n\nAndy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

{"created_at": "24 March, 2022, 10:45 am", "title": "'Bureaucrats - especially mid-level ones - wont allow efficient use of foreign dev funds'", "description": "Official development assistance (ODA) and foreign aid have been a crucial part of the development effort in Bangladesh since its independence in 1971. Over the years, the reliance on ODAs has decreased from 28.7 percent of net central government expenses in 2004 to 12.145 per cent in 2016 and only decreased further in the following years.\nTo many, this may point towards a more self-sufficient future and they may be partially right. However, there may be other underlying factors for the under-use of ODA and foreign aid which are not so complimentary.\nAccording to a recent report, approximately Tk4.5 lakh crore in foreign development funds promised by international development partners remains unused, which could have been used to fund projects crucial to Bangladesh's economic development. For context, the self-funded and highly expensive Padma Bridge only cost about Tk30,000 crores to construct.\n\n\n\nBangladesh, still a least-developed country with LDC graduation on the horizon, can barely afford to leave such a large sum of cheap development funds unused. Then, how did these funds accumulate in the first place? What are the underlying factors that led to this mishap and what can be done to get out of this situation?\nThe Business Standard spoke to Dr Ahsan H Mansur, the Executive Director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh to seek answers to these questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately Tk4.5 lakh crore in foreign funds sits idle in the government treasury. Why is this a problem worth addressing?\nWe have accumulated this problem over many years. The government always thought that it would reduce the rigidity of the funding pipeline. Unfortunately, the rigidity has only increased over the years and the government also has to take responsibility for this.\n\n\n\nLet's assume that the government commits to spending $10 billion in a given year. But in reality, they end up using only 60-65 percent of the funds. The same course of action is repeated the following year. Over the years, these unused funds kept accumulating and we eventually ended up with such a high volume of it.\n\n\n\nSome of these funds may be disbursed later. But many of these projects date back to 15 to 20 years. While it may be possible to carry funds forward from recent years to ongoing projects, it becomes much more complicated when the projects are already complete or have been cancelled many years ago.\nConsequently, government projects are deprived of cheap loans, grants, aid and funding in favour of higher interest loans from other sources, which only increases the burden of government debt.\n\n\n\nBangladesh could have achieved a much higher level of development if these funds were put to proper use. The current amount of unused money is equivalent to approximately three years worth of the annual development budget. We could have undertaken 15 or 16 more mammoth projects like the Padma Bridge.\nUnfortunately, none of that has happened.\n \n\n\n\n\nAhsan H Mansur. Illustration: TBS \nWhy are we unable to process the funds? Are there any systemic problems that need to be addressed?\nFirstly, the project directors or the members of the project management boards are often inefficient and fail to disburse the funds in time. Most of them have trouble communicating in English, the primary language of most of the donors and fail to explain the priorities and demands set by the government properly.\nSecondly, there seems to be a bias among Bangladeshi project directors against foreign donors, especially those from well-regulated democratic countries such as Japan, France, South Korea,etc. Most foreign donors require certain official documentation as well as audits regarding the usage of their funds.\nInstead, our project directors prefer Bangladeshi funding primarily because they understand the procedures and the loopholes in them. Local funding also does not require as much documentation as do its foreign counterparts. So what happens is that we end up using all of our domestic funds while the bulk of the foreign loans or donations is left unused.\nMany experts claim that increased accountability is one of the underlying factors behind the reluctance to use foreign funds. How true is this claim?\nWhether it is the World Bank, JICA or any other international organisation, they require a certain set of official documents before disbursing funds. They have much stronger oversight and it's much more difficult for domestic discretionary forces to influence their decisions, no matter how powerful they are. So, it's difficult to pursue unfair means when it comes to foreign funds, making domestic administrators reluctant in using them unless absolutely necessary.\nThere are issues with the domestic tendering process as well. When international organisations like the World Bank, IMF or JICA disburse funds, they follow the global tendering process. Although the candidates coming from this process are usually the most competent and cost-efficient alternative, bureaucratic red tapes and corruption stand in the way.\nLet me tell you about a particular case. A French Company once won the tender of a project funded by the World Bank in Bangladesh. Although they were competent and the most cost-efficient option available, a certain minister blocked the entire project because his preferred candidate did not win. Later, the project was re-tendered. This time, the French company did not even participate in it. Instead, a Vietnamese company got the tender allegedly after bribing the ones responsible. Interestingly, the project remains incomplete to this day.\nSuch irregularity and corruption in the tendering and procurement process is a major problem in Bangladesh and one of the primary reasons why so much funds remain unused.\nHow can we ensure accountability in the procurement process given the corruption in project management?\nI don't know. Corruption is not exclusive to development projects only. It's ubiquitous and has penetrated every public institution. Bureaucrats hold too much power in the process and they often make outlandish demands like expensive cars, foreign travels, etc, simply to green-light the projects. In a way, foreign companies are held hostage at the hands of these bureaucrats.\nUnless the institutions are transparent and have a robust accountability framework in place, there is not much to be done. For instance, if you look at the companies registered in the Western developed economies, it is far more difficult for them to participate in any form of corrupt dealings. Because if found guilty, they often face severe punishments. For instance, the SNC-Lavalin Group was blacklisted by the World Bank and was banned for 10 years from doing any business.\nOn the flip side, companies from developing countries like China, India, Vietnam, etc, are more comfortable with bribery and other questionable arrangements. Institutions and governments in those countries are also somewhat reluctant to address these issues. This is why our bureaucrats prefer to work with these companies instead of more efficient ones from the West.\nGiven the erosion of preferential treatments after LDC graduation, foreign direct investment will be crucial for economic development. Can the precedence of corruption in the disbursement of foreign funds affect the flow of foreign investment?\nBefore investing in any country, foreign investors usually consult with companies with experience of working in said country. When asked about Bangladesh, they will probably hear about the inefficiencies, bureaucratic red tapes, tax burden and institutional corruption.\nLet me tell you one such story. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Grameenphone wanted to pay their annual taxes in advance but the NBR refused to take it. Later, because of Covid lockdowns, Grameenphone (GP) failed to pay the taxes in time and were fined by the NBR, even though they wanted to pay the taxes beforehand. Earlier in 2019, when the BTRC fined them, GP wanted to go for arbitration [a process where a mediator helps parties reach an agreement without having to go to court]. The government told them there was no such opportunity. Now if you don't allow companies the opportunities to arbitrate, will they feel secure to do business in your country?\nWe had already won hundreds of thousands of kilometres in a sea border dispute with Myanmar. So it made no sense to refuse GP the opportunity for international arbitration.\nBut Grameenphone is not a fringe case. Just take a look at the South Korean EPZ in Ashulia. They bought the land in 1998. To this day, the land registration department has not allowed mutation of the land. And without mutation, they cannot transfer the ownership of the land to anyone.\nUnfortunately, foreign investors are taking note of these incidents and will be thoroughly discouraged to invest their resources in Bangladesh. The Prime Minister wants FDIs and so do her advisers. But as it appears, the bureaucrats, especially the mid-level ones, will not allow the efficient utilisation of foreign development funds.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/24/panorama.png"}
{"created_at": "25 March, 2022, 10:00 am", "title": "Genocide we will not forget", "description": "In January 1971, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto visited Dhaka with a large delegation of his Pakistan People's Party. His goal was one: to explore the chances of forming a grand coalition with the Awami League, the majority party, and so have a share in power at the centre in Islamabad.\nThe Awami League leadership would have nothing to do with Bhutto's plan. He went back home to West Pakistan. Already miffed at the fact that President Yahya Khan had referred, on his own visit to Dhaka after the election, to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as Pakistan's future Prime Minister, Bhutto engaged in intrigue. He invited Yahya Khan to Larkana for what was given out as a duck-shooting programme. It was nothing of the sort. It was, more specifically, an exploration of the ways and means by which the Awami League would be blocked from assuming power despite its landslide victory at the election.\nThe plans for a repudiation of the election results had already been in the works since December. A senior general based in Dhaka told his subordinates in the cantonment within days of the election, \"We will not let these black bastards rule over us.\"\n\n\n\nEverything was falling into place, going according to plan. The Larkana duck-shooting was followed by General Yahya Khan's announcement on 13 February that the National Assembly would convene in Dhaka on 3 March. Two days later, on 15 February, Bhutto made it known that his party would not attend the session. And he would see to it that no one from West Pakistan went to Dhaka.\nOn 1 March, Yahya Khan announced a postponement of the National Assembly session. Bangladesh exploded in protests. A point of no return would soon be reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then came the night of unprecedented horror, following a sham of negotiations and a build-up of troop strength all over Bangladesh in March 1971.\nHow do we recall the horrors of 25 March 1971? To what degree do we recollect the terror we as a nation were subjected to by an organized army even as we waited for a peaceful, pragmatic resolution to the political crisis which overtook the state of Pakistan between the first general election in its history and the repudiation of the results of the election by the civil-military bureaucratic complex based in what was known till then as West Pakistan?\n\n\n\nSome initial facts need revisiting as we proceed to the solemnity associated with Genocide Day. On the evening of 25 March 1971, President Yahya Khan, without calling a formal end to the negotiations his team and that of Pakistan People's Party Chairman Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had been taking part in, left Dhaka stealthily for Karachi. Prior to his departure, he informed General Tikka Khan, the zonal martial law administrator, that military operations were to commence that night but not before he had landed safely in Karachi. Tikka Khan passed on the message to the man entrusted with the inauguration of what would come to be known, euphemistically, as Operation Searchlight. \"Khadim, it is tonight\", General Tikka Khan told General Khadim Hussain Raja.\n\n\n\nThe minutes ticked away as the leadership of the Awami League, the party which had won the election but which was deprived of assuming power in Islamabad, quietly made its way out of a city increasingly getting enveloped in gloom. But Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, despite all attempts at persuading him to go underground, remained firm in his decision not to flee. All through his political career, he had always been ready to be taken into custody because of his innate constitutionalism. In the early minutes of 26 March, he declared Bangladesh's independence and then waited at his residence in Dhanmondi, for the soldiers to come for him.\nThey came, took him first to the under-construction national assembly building, later to be home to Bangladesh's parliament, made him wait as one of their officers informed Tikka Khan on walkie talkie of the Big Bird in their grip. Should they bring him before Tikka? The general's response was crisp --- and rude. \"I don't want to see his face\", he said. Mujib was then taken to Adamjee Cantonment College, where he was to be lodged for a few days before being flown out to prison and trial in West Pakistan.\n\n\n\nAcross Dhaka, the bloodletting commenced, especially in the Dhaka University area. Students' residential halls and the homes of teachers known for their Bengali nationalistic sentiments were the earliest of targets as the night progressed. At Jagannath Hall of the university, scores of students were mown down by the soldiers. The American journalist Sydney Schanberg, who along with other foreign newsmen, had been herded into the Intercontinental Hotel and would subsequently be flown out of Dhaka, remembered the horrors of the night only too well.\nAs Gary J. Bass notes in his revealing 'The Blood Telegram: India's Secret War in East Pakistan', \"They\"  Schanberg and other foreign journalists - \"could see flames from Dacca University, which was a mile and a half away, where, Schanberg says, the army seemed to be shooting artillery.\" In Schanberg's words again, \"They started shooting at students coming from the university, up the road about a mile. They were singing patriotic songs in Bengali. And then the army opened up. We couldn't tell when they hit the ground if they were ducking or killed.\"\nFor Scott Butcher, political officer at the American consulate, the genocide was well underway on 25 March. He too remembered being a witness, from his home in Dhanmondi, to a burning city. He remembered: \"We could hear rhythmic firing which sounded like executions. One time a jeep with machine guns went roaring down our street. We could hear them firing off some rounds.\"\nThe murder of Bengalis had been a coolly and insensitively prepared affair. The army went into preparatory work on the genocide as early as February 1971 when, as Dr MA Hasan notes in 'Beyond Denial: The Evidence of a Genocide', \"On February 22nd 1971, General Yahya, General Hamid, General Pirzada, General Mitha, General Tikka Khan and General Iftekhar Janjua set down the operational plans for the genocide. This diabolical club was given the code-name, Operation Searchlight.\"\nWriting in London's Daily Telegraph on 30 March (Tanks Crush Revolt in Pakistan: 7,000 Slaughtered, Homes Burned), Simon Dring (who had evaded being bundled out of Dhaka by the army by hiding on the roof of the Intercontinental Hotel and who later made a quick tour of the city before making it to West Pakistan) wrote: \"After 24 hours of ruthless, cold-blooded shelling by the Pakistan Army, as many as 7,000 people are dead, large areas have been levelled and East Pakistan's fight for independence has been brutally put to an end.\"\nThe brutality was exercised at the university halls and at the Central Shaheed Minar, the symbol of Bengali nationalist militancy. The entire structure was blown up in the early hours of the genocide and a few bricks placed on the rubble, marking off the hallowed place as a mosque. The army had made up its mind: Islam had to be 'reasserted' in the rebellious province. That entailed destroying anything which pointed to things not Muslim in character or structure. The Kali Mandir, a powerful symbol of Hindu religiosity located in the Race Course, would soon be blown to pieces. The soldiers would then go after the Hindus around the temple, mowing them down furiously.\nThe offices of the People newspaper, behind Sakura restaurant slightly away from the Intercontinental, were put to the torch by the army. ZA Bhutto, who would not be escorted in safety to a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight for Karachi until the morning, watched from his suite in the hotel the flames leaping up highand then higher.\nIn Dhaka, targeted killings by the army went on  on the campus of the university, in the old part of the city, at the police lines in Rajarbagh and at the headquarters of the East Pakistan Rifles (EPR) in Peelkhana. As 26 March dawned, soldiers barged into the home of the venerable academic, philosophy teacher Gobindo Chandra Dev, and shot the life out of him. They killed a teacher of mathematics at Dhaka University. They shot Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta, a scholar and respected teacher of English literature at the university, leaving him writing in agony for a number of days before life went out of him. From his quarters on the campus, from a safe corner of the window, the academic Nurul Ula secretly recorded on his movie camera the killing of students in a field by the army. As Simon Dring reported, \"Caught completely by surprise, some 200 students were killed in Iqbal Hall, headquarters of the militantly anti-government students' uniontwo days later the bodies were still smouldering in their burnt out rooms\"\nLoren Jenkins filed a report for Newsweek: \"From our windows in Dacca's modern Intercontinental Hotel, we watched a jeepful of soldiers roll up to a shopping centre and, taking aim with a heavy machine-gun, open fire on a crowdsome fifteen young Bengalis appeared in the street about 200 yards away and shouted defiantly at the soldiers. The youths seemed to be empty-handed, but the soldiers turned the machine-gun on them anyway.\"\nTime magazine, in its 5 April 1971 report (Pakistan: Toppling over the Brink), saw the situation thus: \"In Dacca, army tanks and truckloads of troops with fixed bayonets came clattering out of their suburban base, shouting 'Victory to Allah' and 'Victory to Pakistan.'\"\nAs night gave way to day, the genocide expanded in scope and ferocity. On Elephant Road, Lt. Commander Muazzam, once an accused in the Agartala case, was dragged out of his home and murdered by Pakistan's soldiers. In the cantonment, officers of the Pakistan army, led by Tikka Khan, enjoyed a hearty breakfast that included fruits, 'fresh from West Pakistan'.\nBrigadier AR Siddiqi, in charge of the army's inter-services public relations (ISPR), writes of 26 March in 'East Pakistan: The Endgame: An Onlooker's Journal 1969-1971': \"Between the day before and now, Dhaka had moved from the path of protest to the road of death and disaster. The truckloads of slogan-chanting young protestors with bloodshot eyes, thirsting for revenge  now seemed to belong to some distant pastDhaka was a ghost city; a monstrous skull with flies buzzing in and out of empty eye sockets.\"\nSiddiqi drove across sections of the city, coming up against bodies of Bengalis sprawled on the streets.\nAll night long on 25-26 March the killings went on. All day on 26 March the horrors kept piling up.\nScott Butcher remembered it all, related it all to Gary Bass: \"I saw bodies rotting in the fieldsI saw a decomposing body left in a main street, obviously left there as an example.\"\nThe genocide went on, relentlessly.\nThis is the story that must now go out to the world, to the United Nations, to Amnesty International, to Human Rights Watch. They need to be told that back in 1971 it was not a civil war which tore Pakistan apart  it was a war for Bengali freedom in light of the perfidy of the Yahya Khan junta. They need to be enlightened with the hard truth as it came to pass on 25 March and the days thereafter.\nAbove all, the world must now be told why Genocide Day matters for this land of Bengali-speaking people. It matters  because it preserves collective memory against forgetting  because it makes us wonder about the long, tortuous path history must travel before the onset of twilight. It matters  because it taught us long ago the meaning of steely resilience.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2021/09/20/syed-badrul-ahsan_3.png"}
{"created_at": "26 March, 2022, 11:35 am", "title": "51 years of Bangladesh: How independent are our women?", "description": "Once called 'a basket case,' Bangladesh has come a long way since the early hours of 26 March 1971 - when the declaration of independence reverberated across the nation through the radio waves.\nToday marks 51 years of independence, and we have several indicators at our disposal that reflect the country's progress and development such as a thriving economy, expansion of healthcare, our climb up in the Human Development Index, digital inclusion among other things.\nHowever, gender inequality and gender-based violence remain rampant, despite the strides we have made for women's rights in the country. After five decades, now the question is - how independent are our women?\n\n\n\nWhile women's rights, empowerment, feminism still remain mostly limited to the confines of the urban population, we must not forget that rural women are the majority with 61.82 percent of the country's population residing in rural areas.\nSTEM, education and the gender-based setbacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2019 study titled \"Barriers to STEM education for rural girls: A missing link to innovation for a better Bangladesh,\" by age 15, girls begin to lose confidence in STEM subjects, unlike boys. The reason is stereotyping STEM as masculine subjects and preconceived social norms - enforced by parents and schools - about what girls can and should do.\nIt is commonplace, even today, to see households encourage and prioritise education for male children over female children. Poverty, social stigma, religious misinterpretation, safety concerns pertaining to girl children result in substantial school dropout rates.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing schooling, rural women's mobility is more restricted due to social norms of \"marrying off the daughter at the right time\" or the stigma of \"working women are characterless.\"\n\n\n\nBefore Covid-19, the organisation I work for wanted to initiate a project primarily based on \"Self Defence\" training for girl students of rural schools. Schools highly appreciated the proposal as parents understood the necessity of self-protection.\nThey need solutions to their fear of letting their daughters leave the house alone. The fear stems from news of assault, rape and murder of women, which, in the reported cases, largely occur outside the house.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the local influential people, neighbours of the students, governing bodies of the schools did not let it happen. They stated, \"these are not for the women from good families.\"\nUnderaged and married\nChild marriage has seen significant declines, statistically speaking since 1991, sure, but the findings of a 2020 UNICEF report will surprise you. It stated that Bangladesh is home to 38 million child brides, and of these, 13 million were married off before age 15.\nMarried girls are over four times more likely to drop out of school than unmarried girls. Nearly five in 10 child brides give birth before the age of 18.\nThe declining trend in child bride has been observed across wealthy groups; this means the rate of child marriage has reduced, largely, among the economically solvent groups but remained the same across other socio-economic groups.\nThus, there is a direct correlation between poverty and child marriages. Marrying off daughters at an early age is synonymous with transferring one extra stomach to feed to another house.\nWomen at the business frontier\nIn a country which invented microfinance, women are facing unreported obstacles to receiving loans. Besides high-interest rates and complex loan processes, one of the problems is the negative attitude of the local bank managers and officials towards women in business.\nThis issue surfaced during a research I have been conducting with Brac on CMSME policy.\nThe most interesting fact is, rural women are asked to \"bring their husbands/fathers/male family members\" to avail loans although no paper or rule dictates this.\n \n\n\n\n\nIshrat Binte Rouf. Illustration: TBS \nA policy/scheme/loans made for \"women entrepreneurs\" where they are asked to bring males to avail accessibility to finance is ironic, to say the least. Two-thirds of Bangladeshi women are missing out on the chance to take control of their money and have a say in financial decision-making.\nDecision-making is key to independence\nBeing able to make your own decisions is a key indicator of independence. South Asian Network on Economic Modelling (Sanem) said, based on their study findings, that women's participation in economic decision-making is still poor even though their income-generating activities have increased substantially in the last decade.\nIn our local governments, women still have ornamental duties.\nThe Local Government (Union Parishad) Second Amendment Act 1997 is a significant step towards ensuring women's equal participation in the political power structure. Yet, women members are marginalised in the major UP functions.\nWords, policies and the law\nThe National Women Development Policy 2011 is slightly backwards from the 1997 Women Development Policy.\nThe recent one states that women would be given full control over the wealth that they have obtained so far through earnings, inheritance, loans, land and market management. Whereas in section 7.2 of the 1997 policy, it was stated that \"Women would be given full and equal rights, and control over earnings, inheritance, wealth, loan, land and wealth earned\".\nThe recent law does not promote equal rights for women, it only mentions women to have full control in whatever they get.\nMuslim law states that a male heir will enjoy two-thirds of property against a female heir who will enjoy one-third. A wife receives one-eighth of the deceased husband's property, whereas the husband receives one-fourth of his deceased wife's property when there is a child.\nAmong Hindus in Bangladesh, a large number of women remain excluded from inheritance. Division of property is a game-changer as the equal property share shifts the power structure.\nPerils of the virtual world\nCyberbullying and online threats cause severe mental trauma. According to the Bangladesh Institute of ICT in Development (BIID)'s survey titled 'Cyberbullying against girls and women over social media' on behalf of the ICT Division - the rate of women and girls falling victim to cyberbullying is 80 percent. Cyber Crime is equally on the rise, especially during the pandemic. People filed 1,528 cases of cyberbullying amid the pandemic in 2020-2021.\nI had the opportunity to interview a girl who had her social media account hacked and compromised. Personal photos were doctored and posted on her profile. She lost her job, the landowner kicked her out of her rented apartment, she had to go back to her village home where her whole family almost disowned her.\nOn a personal note, I would also like to share, my personal inboxes on different social media platforms including Linkedin is full of sexually explicit messages from strangers. This creates a bottleneck for women to socialise, sustain professional relationships, and have a healthy network.\nThis year marks Bangladesh's 51 years of independence, and I believe, it is high time that we look at the state of independence of the women in this country - at the individual/personal level, education level and business level, among other levels, and start to work effectively to repair the flawed systems that allow, breed and perpetuate gender inequality and gender-based violence.\nWomen have a long history of contributing to this country's advancements. However, we still have to fight against discrimination, domestic abuse, sexual violence, discriminatory views policies, restrictions on education and movement, early marriage on a daily basis.\nWe are celebrating independence day today, but how many stories and articles, history lessons, movies based on the Liberation War feature women, or even focus on women, have you come across? Not many I would assume.\nHow many of us know about Kakon Bibi who joined the Liberation War leaving her three-day-old infant at home? People hardly know about Bir Pratik Captain Dr Sitara Begum and Bir Pratik Taramon Bibi, our two brave Guerrilla fighters.\nGeeta Kar was just 15 years old when she joined the war. Shirin Banu disguised herself as a boy in 1971 to fight for our liberation. Rounak Mohal Dilruba Begum was a war trainer who prepared six groups of young people.\nWomen role models need more of our attention and focus. National policies should be more gender-inclusive. Laws and regulations need to be free from gender biases and negative influences so that women victims get prompt and exemplary justice.\nWhile we continue to thrive as an independent country in various indices and global platforms, independence of women from social norms, preconceived patriarchal ideologies, discriminatory policies - and much more - is yet to be attained.\nOur battle for gender equality still rages on. Let us keep on fighting.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/26/panorama_illustration_25_03_2022.jpg"}

On the other hand, the wage rate of the working people increased by only 6.03% at the same time.\nPrivate consumption accounts for 69% of the country's GDP, according to government data.\n\n\n\n\nTo see how consumers are tightening their belts by cutting non-essential spending, take Amjad Hossain, owner of an eatery at Mogbazar's Dilu Road. A month back, he would require 30-32 kilograms of flour a day to make roti and paratha at his restaurant but now he is using 24-25 kg as diners start to stay away from his modest place.\nRotis became smaller and he now uses a few drops of oil to fry parathas with its current astronomic price.\n\n\n\"Our sales have been going down since February. We have reduced the amount of food preparation too than a month ago,\" said Amjad.\n\n\n\nKeep reading-\n\nWatch out for supply crunch too - Dr Salehuddin Ahmed\nFocus on boosting poor's purchasing power - Dr Sayema Haque Bidisha\nPrices stable as profit margin narrow - Kamruzzaman Kamal\nImporters to incur losses if consumers spend less - Tariq Ahmed\n\n\nMany small and big restaurants in the capital had to reduce the amount of food they serve to their customers without hiking prices to keep customers happy. Nevertheless, customers are mainly staying away from restaurant food because with no income growth, they are grappling with rising cost of living.\n\n\nTo balance spending with income, middle- and lower-income households are now cutting back on cost by eating less. They are also using less oil and spices in cooking.\nThey are now careful to spend unless it is essential, as reflected in declining sales of mobile and electronics products. Be it in Dhaka's Karwan Bazar or Chattogram's Khatunganj wholesale market, the consumers' response to buying necessary goods for the upcoming Ramadan is lukewarm.\nTraders claim that sales of daily commodities in the retail markets are also lower than usual.\nWhile buying baby food or cosmetics, consumers are now going for smaller packs. On the other hand, fashion houses are worried about their turnaround with big sales ahead of Pahela Baishakh and Eid as consumer spending is shrinking.\nEconomists say consumers now are not buying non-essential products, such as clothing, furniture, electronics and other luxury items to meet additional food costs as their income growth is lower than the inflation.\nDr Ahsan H Mansur, executive director at Policy Research Institute, told The Business Standard, \"Wages of day labourers are not keeping up with rising commodity prices. So they are unable to buy the amount of food they used to earlier.\"\nThe working-class people's real income has decreased, he added.\nWhen income falls, the first casualty for the low income people is their food intake. To make ends meet, many people take their children out of schools and send them out for work, he noted.\nMany are forced to forego medical expenses, leading to a loss of future productivity, the economist added.\nConsumers looking for cheaper alternatives\n \n\n\n\n\nPhoto: Noor A Alam\nRising commodity prices are pushing limited-income consumers to go for cheaper products. In the case of rice, they no longer seek out premium quality. They are buying non-branded products in a smaller amount.\nSabbir Ahmed, owner of a rice shop in Dhaka's Segunbagicha kitchen market, told TBS many of his customers, who used to get fine rice earlier, are now opting for coarse rice.\nMiniket variety now costs Tk66-Tk68 per kg, while coarse one is sold at Tk50-Tk55, he said.\n\"My fine quality rice sales dropped to 50 kg a day from 80-100 kg a few days ago,\" Sabbir said.\nAminul Islam, a vegetable seller in the same market, said his sales are declining too because of high prices.\nHe now cannot even sell 5 kg of pointed gourd (potol) a day as it costs Tk80 per kg. The people are also refraining from buying other expensive vegetables, such as brinjal, pumpkin, bitter gourd and lemon.\nThe consumers are mostly buying potatoes and tomatoes that now sell cheaper, Aminul said.\nThe middle-class people, who used to buy from super shops, are also looking for cheaper alternatives.\nShamim Ahmed Jaigirdar, head of Operation at Meena Bazar, said sales of cosmetics of brands, such as Square, Unilever, have dropped significantly over the last few days. Sales in February were down 8% month-on-month.\nSales of vegetables have also declined significantly. Besides, the people are now buying small packs of soap, oil and shampoo, he added.\nFashion houses stare at dull Eid business\n \n\n\n\n\nRepresentational image. Picture: Pixabay \nFashion houses in the country were gradually bouncing back from Covid-induced losses. After logging good sales in the winter, they were expecting good business in the summer season as well. But rallying commodity prices have made them apprehensive that their business recovery will get hit during the forthcoming Pahela Baishakh and Eid festivals.\nTraders, however, told TBS that even though the volume of their current sales is below the normal level, it is still satisfactory.\nShahin Ahmed, president of the Bangladesh Fashion Designers' Association and owner of Anjans, said, \"The coronavirus and inflation have already made a dent in people's pockets. As a result, we haven't taken much preparation for this Pahela Baishakh, but our preparation for Eid-ul-Fitr is good.\"\nElectronics, motorcycles sales at slow pace\n \n\n\n\n\nPhoto : Motorcycles showcased in front of a showroom.\nSales of electronics products including TVs, refrigerators, and mobile handsets were quite normal even amid the peak of the pandemic. On the other hand, motorbike sales that witnessed sloth during the pandemic peak in 2020 recovered quite well in 2021.\nBut, the recent surge in prices of essentials has taken a toll on the sales of these products. There has been a negative 5% growth in mobile phone sales since February this year, sales of the low-cost motorcycles have also fallen into a somewhat slow growth trajectory.\nSM Rejoan Alam, chief business officer (CBO) of Walton Mobile, said electric products usually see high growth in sales during summer but the trend is not the same this year. Mobile phone sales also are lower compared to last year, he added.\nBiplob Kumar Roy, general secretary of the Bangladesh Motorcycle Assemblers and Manufacturers Association (BMAMA), said the demand for high-capacity bikes is on the rise since the industry began to reduce the prices for manufacturing them locally.\nBut, the demand for cheaper two-wheelers has dropped significantly, reflecting the hesitation of cost conscious customers.\nDemand for fast-moving Ramadan items yet to pick pace\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSales of commodities that remain fast moving during the month of Ramadan usually go up at Khatunganj in Chattogram, the largest wholesale market for daily commodities in the country, since Shab-e-Barat and keep rising up to the start of Ramadan. At the same time, prices also go up.\nBut the turnover is less than usual this year. Besides, prices of commodities also are in a rather downward trend.\nAzizul Haque, proprietor of Haque Trading, a consumer goods trader in Khatunganj, told TBS that before Ramadan, usually this time of the year, congestions of transport vehicles are created from the Kotwali intersection of the port city to Khatunganj, thanks to the huge sales pressure in the wholesale market. But this year sales in the market are so low that there are hardly any transport vehicles in the market.\nHabibur Rahman, proprietor of Bhai Bhai Store in Karwan Bazar, the largest wholesale market in the capital, said demand for daily commodities including gram, rice, pulses, and oil has increased to some extent ahead of Ramadan, but the increase is much less when compared to the previous years.\nMost of the consumers are now looking for cheaper products, he added.\nHotel business in a fix\nThe rallying commodities have put eatery businesses in a difficult situation. To cope with the situation, most hotels have opted for reducing portion size instead of hiking the price. But many of them could not but raise the prices of some items including fish, meat, and vegetables in the wake of unusual hikes in the prices of these commodities in recent months.\nAs such, footfalls at restaurants are dropping gradually.\nTahmina Ferdousi, chief operating officer of online food delivery service HungryNaki, said the amount of food served may have decreased in hotels. As such, the prices of the items have not increased that much. Besides, the food delivery companies are retaining the consumers through various offers. As a result, although growth has slowed down, sales have not slowed down as yet.\nFahim Ahmed, chief executive officer of Pathao, said as his company focuses on customers who prioritise quality and service over discounts, order growth in Pathao Food is yet to slow down.\nHe, however, expressed concerns that the situation may take a turn for the worse in the coming days if commodity prices keep surging.", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/24/supermarket-5202138_1920.jpg"}

Moscow had said its goals included demilitarising Ukraine. Western officials dismiss this as a baseless pretext for a war they say is aimed at toppling Ukraine's government.\n\n\n\n\nFacing stiff resistance, Russian troops have failed to capture any major city in the month since invading Ukraine. Instead, they have bombarded cities, laid waste to urban areas and driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes.\nMore than 3.7 million of them have fled abroad, half to neighbouring Poland, where US President Joe Biden met soldiers from the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division bolstering the NATO alliance's eastern flank.\n\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of people are being cut off from help by Russian forces and are besieged in places like Mariupol,\" Biden said, referring to the besieged southeastern port.\n\n\n\"It's like something out of a science fiction movie.\"\nBattlelines near Kyiv have been frozen for weeks with two main Russian armoured columns stuck northwest and east of the capital. A British intelligence report described a Ukrainian counter-offensive that had pushed Russians back in the east.\n\n\n\"Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, have allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 km east of Kyiv,\" the report said. Both the United States and Britain have given Ukraine arms.\n'UNPREPARED TROOPS'\nRussia's defence ministry said 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed 3,825 wounded, the Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine says 15,000 Russian soldiers have died.\nVolodymyr Borysenko, mayor of Boryspol, an eastern suburb where Kyiv's main airport is located, said 20,000 civilians had evacuated the area, answering a call to clear out so Ukrainian troops could counter-attack.\nUkrainian forces recaptured a nearby village the previous day and would have pushed on but halted to avoid putting civilians in danger, Borysenko said.\nOn the other main front outside Kyiv, to the capital's northwest, Ukrainian forces have been trying to encircle Russian troops in the suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, reduced to ruins by heavy fighting.\nIn Bucha, 25 km (15 miles) northwest of Kyiv, a small group of Ukrainian troops armed with anti-tank missiles was digging foxholes. A Ukrainian soldier who identified himself only as Andriy told Reuters he enlisted as soon as the invasion began.\n\"I told my wife to grab the children and to hide in the basement, and I went to the drafting station and joined my unit straight away,\" he said.\nIn the Vinnytsia area west of Kyiv, the Ukrainian Air Force said Russian cruise missiles hit several buildings while attempting to strike the Air Force's command in the area.\nThe United Nations said it had confirmed 1,081 civilian deaths and 1,707 injuries in Ukraine since the February 24 invasion, adding that the real toll was likely higher.\nMariupol, a city of 400,000 before the war, has been among the worst hit by the Russian bombardment. Tens of thousands of people are still believed to be trapped with little access to food, power or heat.\nLocal officials, citing witness accounts, said they estimated that 300 people were killed in the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol on March 16. The city council had not previously provided a toll and made clear it was not possible to determine an exact figure after the incident. Russia has denied bombing the theatre.\nThe governor of Ukraine's Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Ukrainian forces still controlled Mariupol. Around 65,000 people had fled but efforts to organise mass evacuations under ceasefires had mostly failed.\nThe cities of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy in the east have also endured devastating bombardment. Chernihiv was effectively surrounded by Russian forces, its governor said.\nCULTURE WAR?\nWeeks of on-and-off peace talks have failed to make significant progress. In a video address late Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his troops' resistance had dealt Russia \"powerful blows\".\n\"Our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: we must talk, talk meaningfully, urgently and fairly,\" Zelenskiy said.\nWestern sanctions have isolated Russia from global trade. President Vladimir Putin accused the West of trying to \"cancel\" Russian culture, including composers Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninov, comparing it to actions by Nazi Germany in the 1930s.\nChina is the biggest power not to have condemned the Russian invasion and has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions.\nBut in the first big sign that Western sanctions on Moscow were hurting investment from China, sources said state-run Sinopec Group, Asia's biggest oil refiner, halted talks on a petrochemical investment and a venture to market Russian gas.\n\"Companies will rigidly follow Beijing's foreign policy in this crisis,\" said an executive at a Chinese state oil company. \"There's no room whatsoever for companies to take any initiatives in terms of new investment.\"", "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/images/2022/03/26/2022-03-25t204242z_102624731_rc2q9t9podoa_rtrmadp_3_ukrainie-crisis-mariupol.jpg"}

But with pollsters warning that abstentions could reach a record level, he needs to get supporters fired up enough to make the effort to go out and vote for him.\n\"There is no magic in this campaign. Nobody's excited, not the French, not political journalists, not even us in the campaign,\" one source in the Macron camp said. \"The war in Ukraine has shut everything down.\"\n\n\n\nMacron's diplomatic activism over Ukraine gave him an initial poll boost, but some campaign insiders now worry that his efforts are distracting from the fight at home.\n\"Next week is an important week,\" the same source said. \"We need to show we're campaigning on the ground.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president has kept campaign events to a minimum, relying mostly on social media posts, including a few Instagram shots of him looking tired and unshaven in between diplomatic calls at his desk. Other contenders have been left to debate between themselves on TV shows that fail to attract many viewers.\nA campaign rally in the French Riviera city of Nice with current and former ministers but no Macron - he sent a three-minute pre-recorded message - failed to fill the venue, French media said.\n\n\n\nAfter releasing his manifesto last week, Macron gave two interviews, including one on French radio during which a caller told him to spend less time on Ukraine and focus more on the needs of his country.\n\n\n\nBut on Thursday, Macron flew to Brussels for two days of NATO, G7 and European summits.\n\"We're a bit bored, to be honest,\" said another source close to Macron who stayed in Paris. \"We need to hear the message of those who want the president to be more present at home.\"\n\n\n\nNO NEW WORLD\nThe centre-left faction within Macron's party is also worried that the only measures voters will remember from his manifesto are tough and unpopular, like pushing back the retirement age to 65 and compulsory community work for welfare recipients.\n\"Not something that captures your imagination,\" a lawmaker quipped, lamenting the \"optimism\" of Macron's 2017 campaign, which promised a \"new world\" breaking with the politics of past decades. \"We need to be careful about abstention,\" he said.\nAfter reaching a record 31.5% in the rolling Ifop poll on 9 March, as the Ukraine crisis unfolded, the proportion of people saying they intend to vote for Macron has slid to 28.5%.\n\"That's the cost of clarity.

{"created_at": "26 March, 2022, 12:00 pm", "title": "51 years of living dangerously", "description": "There is so much that Bangladesh has been naturally blessed with.\nFor example: Flat, arable land with greenery all over, a multitude of rivers, a tropical climate that Western holiday-seekers would pay a premium for, access to the ocean. Take a step back, rewind in your mind to a time before all this so-called development took place in this country, and what you get is a Goldilocks-style \"just right\" location of staggering natural beauty.\nIf the distribution of wealth were spread equitably around the world, if all countries had similar types of government with the same rights and responsibilities for all citizens, and the same levels of environmental pollution, and I were asked by a genie popping out from a lamp where in God's green earth I wished to live, without reservation I would say Bangladesh. You can keep the permafrost of the Nordic countries kissing the Arctic Circle, and the never-ending winter chills of Canada. You can keep the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions of Japan, or the breathtaking yet ruggedly treacherous terrains of New Zealand or Australia. I am perfectly happy to put my roots down right here, near the banks of the Buriganga, I would tell this genie. Bangladesh is my home, and I am not moving.\n\n\n\nThere will, no doubt, on the occasion of Bangladesh's 51st Independence Day, be a deluge of newspaper pieces  op-ed pieces and feature stories and flag-waving editorials  that celebrate the \"development journey\" of Bangladesh, praising us for how far we have come.\nThey will be correct on some points: It is true, for example, that for a country with a history of famine, we have made remarkable strides in food production, and while we are still a long way from realistically banishing the hunger problem, the food crisis is not as dire as it has been in the past. Big business has boomed, and a quick look around our capital city makes it clear that there are people in this country with plenty of money to burn, and this wealth flows down into the hands of employees who are now able to have a standard of life  filled with imported consumer goods and frequent foreign vacations (pandemic notwithstanding)  that could not have been dreamt of by previous generations. These gains I will gladly acknowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yet, the reality is, the vast majority of us would not tell the genie from the lamp that we are happy with Bangladesh as is, because the grim truth is that we have wreaked havoc on this land throughout the five decades since independence, and all the things that once made Bangladesh a geographical jackpot have been all but ruined.\nOur rivers are so polluted they are increasingly hostile to marine life. Report after report has shown the air of our cities to be some of the worst air in the world  this is no mere opinion, but scientific fact: Our AQI is consistently abysmal. To say our big cities are overpopulated would be a grave understatement  our jaw-droppingly bad traffic situation defies all description. Indeed, the traffic problem in Dhaka can only be comprehended by residents of this city who deal with this traffic on a regular basis; explaining it to an outside party is a nearly impossible task.\n\n\n\nSo to the genie from the lamp, this genie making his best sales pitch, highlighting how our land, climate, location, and topography make us the top prize of not just Asia but the world, most of us, given the reality of the year 2022, would probably say \"no thanks.\" Even many of those who wax patriotic in op-ed columns cheering on Bangladesh's progress actually live abroad, or secretly pour their energies into trying to leave the country, and emigrate the first chance they get. Do not get them wrong, please. They still love Bangladesh with all their hearts. They just prefer to do it from a distance, is all.\n\n\n\nYours truly is not one such NRB. Bangladesh is my home, and I, like millions of other ordinary citizens, deal with its realities day in and day out. We were given a good thing once upon a time, but five decades of political short-sightedness, greed, bad planning, and broken political institutions that have failed to hold polluters accountable have turned Bangladesh into a nearly unlivable place. That is our reality. That is the truth we feel in our bones.\nI leave it to the economists to sing praises of our GDP numbers. As I said, their assessment isn't exactly wrong. But ultimately, a country's value is about how it makes us feel, how much it allows us to live a healthy, fulfilling life, a life free of constant stressors and anxieties, a life with social and political freedoms that allow us to reach for our potential, and to pursue happiness.\n\n\n\nMy dream for this nation for the next half-decade is that we will focus on those things which truly matter, so that bright young people of future generations, from the heart, choose to live in Bangladesh and build their lives and careers here, instead of dreaming of something better in foreign shores.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAbak Hussain.
